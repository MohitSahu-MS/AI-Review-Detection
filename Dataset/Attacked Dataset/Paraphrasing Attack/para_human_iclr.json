The algorithm assumes that the loss function can be approximated by a parabola along the negative direction of the normalized batch gradient. Thus the optimal step size can be estimated as the distance to the minimum of this parabola. The authors observe that the optimal step size usually remains constant during SGD optimization allowing for its reuse over multiple iterations reducing computational complexity. Strengths and Weaknesses This paper introduces an algorithm for automatically selecting the step size for SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) which is used for DNN (Deep Neural Network) training. The algorithm approximates the loss function along the negative direction of the normalized batch gradient with a parabola enabling the estimation of the optimal step size. Weaknesses 1. Limited Novelty: The proposed LABPAL method is not entirely new as it is a modification of the existing PAL algorithm. The main difference lies in the way the parabolic approximation is performed which might be considered a minor adjustment. Moreover the experimental basis for the parabolic approximation (Observations 16) and their illustrations are nearly identical to those found in a previous paper. Other technical details like adapting the algorithm to varying gradient noise and its relation to the first Wolfe constant have limited significance for the papers main argument. 2. Insufficient Reasoning: Observation 2 draws a conclusion based on a limited dataset and model raising concerns about its generalizability to other scenarios. Strengths 1. Effective Performance: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed LABPAL method outperforms other benchmark methods on various datasets. LABPAL also exhibits robustness delivering stable results across different hyperparameter settings.", "Paraphrase: This research introduces LABPAL a novel line search algorithm that enhances training performance for image classification tasks. LABPAL utilizes a parabola to approximate the complete loss function along the minibatch gradient direction then identifies the parabolas minimum to determine the optimal step size.

Weaknesses:  The algorithms design is based on observations from image classification tasks and its generalization to other domains like NLP is unknown.  Several arbitrary design decisions and additional hyperparameters introduce complexity in tuning.  While LABPALs benefits are demonstrated in experiments it is not compared against the superior optimizer SGD with Momentum.

The approach is inspired by empirical observations during the training of ResNet20 on CIFAR10. Evaluation: The method is compared to other line search strategies for SGD (including constant and piecewise learning rates) using three datasets (CIFAR100) and three network architectures (Resnet20 MobileNetV2 DenseNet121). Additionally the authors demonstrate how to mitigate noise in gradient estimation using a smaller minibatch size (10). Strengths and Weaknesses: Adaptive learning methods are valuable for SGD and enhancements over previous line search approaches have potential impact. However the evaluation of different methods in this study has limitations:  Lack of comparison with more common learning rate strategies (e.g. constant or piecewise constant).  Incorrect evaluation of some methods (e.g. SLS performing poorly despite previous positive results).  Suboptimal hyperparameter tuning (e.g. coarse grid search and low achieved accuracy). Other Comments:  The study cites a specific paper for the claim that Gradientonly Line Search (GOLSI) has poor performance.  The assumption that all results are based on a single study with ResNet18 on CIFAR10 may limit generalizability.  The statement that increasing batch size reduces gradient noise is countered by literature suggesting the opposite.  The authors use a batch size of 10 to simulate gradient noise increase but it would be beneficial to investigate intermediate batch sizes.", "Paraphrased Summary: This research introduces LABPAL a line search method that enhances SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) for neural network training. It aims to address limitations of previous line search methods which either assume an accurate descent direction or rely on minibatches that can compromise robustness. LABPAL utilizes two key observations: (1) the fullbatch loss forms a parabola along SGD update directions and (2) the optimal step size adjusts gradually. With these insights LABPAL estimates the full loss using multiple large minibatches and adjusts the step size using a backtracking line search. Extensive experiments with image classification models demonstrate that LABPAL outperforms both vanilla SGD and normalized SGD. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths:  LABPAL improves upon SGD without requiring finetuning. Weaknesses:  LABPAL is compared only to SGD excluding SGD with momentum despite their similarities. This limits LABPALs practical utility.  LABPALs reliance on empirical observations specific to image classification limits its applicability to other tasks.  Certain hyperparameters in LABPAL may not generalize well across different scenarios.

Trains the model using a convex combination of empirical losses on the labeled and pseudolabeled unlabeled data. Under specific assumptions including the realizability of the ground truth exact observation of labels and model structure the algorithm exhibits surprising results:  Theorem 2: With suitable parameter choices the model converges towards the ground truth with an assumption on the number of samples that is similar to supervised learning without unlabeled data.  Theorem 1: Under weaker conditions the model converges towards a combination of the ground truth and the initial model outperforming the initial model. Key Findings  The algorithm acts as an optimization trick improving performance in datasparse regimes by leveraging a form of selfregularization.

Notably the authors suggest that learning f(x) does not depend on the prior \u0394 implying that this representation is immune to prior misspecifications. The papers key contributions are: 1. Theorem 3: When f(x) perfectly optimizes the reconstruction loss a linear combination of its output can exactly match the expected value of any polynomial summary function of w under the posterior. 2. Theorem 4: Even if f(x) is not an optimal solution there exists a linear function such that the error bound for all documents remains limited. 3. Theorem 5: The contrastive objective enables the recovery of expected polynomial summaries of w under the posterior with a linear function. Empirical evaluations on simulated and realworld data demonstrate that the proposed SSL method outperforms Bayesian inference with an incorrect prior. In the classification task using realworld data SSL performs comparably to existing methods.", "Paraphrased Summary: This paper presents a groundbreaking method for topic model inference using selfsupervised learning.

Benefits of Asymptotically Stable Neural ODEs:  Asymptotically stable neural ODEs maintain expressivity while ensuring that solutions converge to a stable equilibrium point over time.  There are examples of unstable neural ODEs without diffeomorphisms but such models are not commonly used in practice.  Periodic solutions are not permitted by the definition of asymptotic stability but experiments show that these dynamics can still occur in practice. Advantages of Using Diffeomorphisms:  Composing an ODE with a diffeomorphism allows solutions to be obtained without evaluating the diffeomorphisms Jacobian.  However this advantage is not significant as multiplying by the Jacobian is relatively efficient. Applications:  The entire model can be represented as an ODE which may be beneficial in time series problems.  Diffeomorphisms are required for training continuous normalizing flows.

An intervention policy that switches between the primary and safety policies. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on several toy environments including Tmaze Lunar Lander and Safety Gym Benchmark.

However this information was available in the code released by the authors. While clarifying the information is valuable calling the omission misleading is an exaggeration.  Misleading Point 2: The paper criticizes Kusner et al. for not using the same normalization for document vectors obtained by bagofwords (BoW) and TFIDF methods. However the original paper included other comparison methods that performed comparably to word movers distance (WMD). This paper acknowledges this.

This is essential for estimating the only estimable parameter WWT. Their approach is similar to Wu et al.s with adjustments to account for outliers using trimmed mean or median estimates. Strengths and Weaknesses This welldefined problem is addressed and the authors advance prior generative model parameter estimation techniques which often ignored outliers. Technically their methodology largely parallels Wu et al.s with a minor adjustment for outliers. However the results may not converge to Wu et al.s findings when the probability of uncorruption approaches 1. The precision of parameter estimation is also unclear.

The poor performance of standard gradient descent for p0.95 is unusual.  gt in the appendix seems to refer to \\tilde gt.", "Paraphrased Statement: Researchers consider a model where a fraction (p) of observations come from a rectified linear unit (ReLU) distribution with parameters W and b while the remaining observations come from an arbitrary distribution. They aim to estimate these parameters. Strengths:  The approach separates the estimation of W and b into two parts.  A random projectionbased method is used to estimate angles between rows of W.  The researchers provide error bounds for their method. Weaknesses:  The error multiplier in the bound is large (at least 3\u03c0).  The error does not converge to zero as the sample size increases even in the absence of outliers.  In simulations the gradient descent method with filters does not show decreasing error with increasing sample size. Questions and Concerns:  The number of gradient descent iterations is set to 100 but its unclear if this is sufficient.  The error decrease with iterations is not shown for specific values of n d and p.  The reason for discarding examples with zero entries is not explained.  The parameters \u03b7 and L in Proposition 4.2 are not defined in the main text.  The matrix transpose in the definition of \u039e is not justified.  The similarity between the bounds in equation (18) and Theorem 4.3 is superficial as the former can be improved by increasing the sample size while the latter cannot.", "Paraphrased Summary: The paper describes a method for training singlelayer ReLU networks under the Huber contamination model where a certain percentage of training samples may be corrupted.

Estimating the angles between rows using properties of inner products with Gaussian vectors. Strengths:  The paper is wellwritten.  The techniques are intuitive and make sense.  The results align with previous findings for training networks without outliers. Weaknesses:  The algorithm relies heavily on the assumption that the input data follows an i.i.d. Gaussian distribution which is unrealistic in practice.  The generalizability of the techniques to nonGaussian inputs is unclear.  The claim about learnability (training the entire weight matrix) is confusing as the main results only cover learning the row norms of the weight matrix.

The use of twodimensional unitary planar rotators for constructing arbitrary unitary operations is not novel. The beam splitter gate is essentially a MachZehnder interferometer. The parametrization of the unitary group was outlined in the 1962 publication \"The Unitary and Rotation Groups\" by Francis D. Murnaghan.

Training rotation phases in the unitary parametrization space with robustness and discretization considerations have been explored in previous literature. Onchip techniques exist for training rotation phases without external backpropagation. Furthermore there are prior studies that address gradient explosion issues in RNNs using similar unitary operators. 2. Major: The robustness of the proposed orthogonal layer is uncertain. The triangular array used to construct an arbitrary unitary has a depth of 2N3 which could lead to significant angle error accumulation a wellknown issue in optical neural networks. Shallower quantum neural layers may be less susceptible to quantum noise. Rectangular and butterfly mesh structures may also exhibit better noise tolerance. 3.

The authors represent the problem as a latent variable model. To address the Monte Carlo estimation challenge with CUBO (Dieng et al. 2017) they propose an upper bound based on CUBO modified by an exponential divergence in addition to the standard variational lower bound (ELBO). Furthermore they introduce surrogate parametrization to decrease gradient variance. Experimental results on UCI datasets with intentionally missing features demonstrate modest improvements over existing benchmarks.

DecentCEM runs multiple parallel CEM instances with different policies allowing it to explore a wider range of actions and increase sample efficiency. Strengths and Weaknesses: The motivation for DecentCEM is to address the issue of CEM being unable to effectively handle multimodal action distributions. However this issue is not significant in the modelbased RL experiments conducted in the OpenAI tasks as the algorithms entropy is sufficient to break the multiple solutions. The experiments show limited improvement of DecentCEM over other methods. Additionally there is no evaluation of whether the parallel structure reduces computation time and the increased computational complexity of training multiple policies counteracts any potential benefits. While the paper is wellwritten and easy to follow the concept and motivation behind DecentCEM are lacking. The use of parallel CEM policies is a straightforward extension of Poplin with uncertain advantages. A better approach to address CEMs Gaussian assumption would be to use sequential Monte Carlo methods that can handle multimodal solutions.

Unlike previous CEM approaches which employed a centralized method based on a Gaussian or Gaussian mixture distribution (GMM) this decentralized CEM allows each individual instance to independently track its own data and topk estimates. The paper begins with a 1D toy experiment demonstrating that the decentralized CEM converges to the global optimum more effectively than the centralized CEM with GMM. Subsequent experiments on several modelbased RL tasks show that the decentralized CEM outperforms previous methods on some tasks while performing similarly or slightly worse on others. Strengths:  The concept is simple yet effective.  The paper is wellwritten and easy to understand.  The mathematical equations are concise and clear.  The appendix provides detailed information on hyperparameter settings.  Replicating the experiments is feasible for other researchers.  The 1D toy example provides a useful visual illustration. Weaknesses:  The modelbased RL results are not particularly strong with some noisy curves and instances where the decentralized CEM performs poorly.  Hyperparameter choices made in the toy experiment are not fully reported and it would be useful to provide more information on the number of mixture components and instances used.

An example illustrates how using an ensemble aids in escaping local minima. Strengths:  Ensemble optimization effectively explores the solution space.  The benchmark and baselines are appropriate including SAC as a reference.  Simulation results show comparable or superior performance to other CEM variants.  The paper is generally clear and concise.

Initially the output values are unknown but queries can be made to label data points. The paper proposes a methodology to identify constant segments of the output signal based on input features (x) and labeled timestamps (y). This is achieved by using a thresholding rule to determine segments where the predicted output values at a given time point are close to the labeled values. The identified segments are treated as having true labels. The learned model for the relationship between inputs and outputs is then updated and new query points are selected for labeling based on the current model. This process is repeated until a desired number of iterations or a convergence criterion is met. Strengths:  The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  The paper presents a simple and practical approach that performs well. Weaknesses:  The updating rules based on the learned model may be susceptible to overconfidence especially when the model is uncertain.

Missing information on computational complexity. Main Comments: Equation 3: It appears that `(cws)` values are calculated separately for each plateau. However these values may share similarities for a specific class label `(yl)`. Exploring a model that connects `(cl wl sl)` to `yl` may be beneficial.

Exploring complexity reduction techniques such as sampling relevant plateau models is recommended.  The rationale behind using `b  85` for the mHealth dataset and `b  200` for others needs justification.

Strengths and Weaknesses  The paper is generally wellstructured and easy to follow.  However there are concerns regarding the correctness of the approach:  The statement that \"certifiable robustness processes usually imply epsilonrobustness\" is not necessarily true.  Failure of a certified robustness check does not guarantee the presence of an adversarial point within the epsilon ball.  It is not clear how to determine the set of points for which the model is epsilonrobust as the certified robust set may miss some points that are actually robust.  The papers claims that the system can flag nonadversarial inputs as adversarial may be misleading as the system is only indicating whether a given point is certifiably robust or not.  Certified robustness is often probabilistic which is not considered in the paper.  A comparison to other attacks such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) would be valuable for evaluating the performance of the proposed degradation attacks. Minor Comments  The paper uses different approaches for constructing smoothed classifiers (Algorithm 3.2 vs. Lecuyer et al.).  There is a slight abuse of notation in Algorithm 3.2 regarding the decomposition of noise vectors.  The assumption in 3.3.1 should specify that there are no other points of a different class label close to x.  Lower and upper bounds on the same graphs (Fig 2) would provide a better visual representation of their tightness.  Defense 4.2 may not be practical as membership of M is often not computable.", "Paraphrase: Summary This study unveils a weakness in the GloRo and randomized smoothing defense mechanisms. The attack targets inputs located within the robustness region that are difficult to certify leading to false rejections. The attack employs a modified PGD attack with smoothed variance. Experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of these certification methods to the proposed attack. Strengths:  Verified accuracy rates for randomized smoothing and GloRo decrease under the new attack.  A mitigation strategy is presented for the vulnerability. Weaknesses:  Practical applicability of the attack is questionable since verification aids in robustness assessments. Verified samples can be trusted while unverified samples do not necessarily warrant rejection. Other robustness measures and prediction confidence scores are available. GloRos rejection mechanism is based on achieving global certified robustness with a global Lipschitz constant ultimately serving as local robustness verification.  The example in Figure 1 is flawed. Adversarial examples exist when the true robustness region of x intersects the decision boundary. Determistic verification methods like GloRo should reject such examples unless weights are retrained to adjust the decision boundary.  Overly cautious behavior is fundamental to certifiable defense mechanisms focusing on samples within the input distribution. Encouraging certified robustness beyond this distribution is impractical unless global verification is required.  The modified PGD attack lacks significant novelty as similar methods exist for training and outperforming randomized smoothing alone. The attack should be compared against other stateoftheart verifiers and certified training methods as well.", "Summarized Statement: The study explores a novel attack strategy against certified robust machine learning models at the time of testing. The attackers can apply imperceptible modifications to the input data to trigger a false positive detection of adversarial examples thereby reducing the models overall effectiveness.

The problem setup is intuitive and highlights the challenges of information loss during testing.  The theoretical analysis is clear and accessible. Weaknesses:  Doubleradius defenses discussion is unclear. It is not clear whether the defense abstains at a radius of 2\u03b5 as stated in Algorithm 2.1 or if the models are trained with this parameter during testing.

The authors use this observation to design an attack where bounded modifications impair the functionality of certified robust networks by compelling them to reject otherwise valid inputs. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths:  The observation is straightforward practical and thoroughly assessed. Weaknesses:  It is unclear if the observation is novel in its current form.  The constraint \"One need not assume that the inputs are scaled to be in [01]d\" is unclearly explained.  The motivation for Figure 1 could benefit from a practical example.

Additionally NVC is not limited to targeting specific words or predetermined frequency ranges making it harder to detect and mitigate. Experiments demonstrate that NVC significantly increases the Word Error Rate (WER) of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model compared to other NVC methods. The study also provides various analyses of NVCs behavioral characteristics to guide future research. Experiments simulate realworld scenarios to assess NVCs performance.

The extensive experiments indicate that the authors have thoroughly considered realworld scenarios and provide valuable insights for further research. Weaknesses:  The paper can be difficult to comprehend due to unconventional indexing notation.  The notion of \u03b4 requires clarification as to whether it represents exact computation time or a range.

They modify the existing FairBatch (FB) algorithm for the decentralized Federated Learning (FL) environment. Their experimental results demonstrate that their algorithm FedFB achieves better fairness compared to a centralized approach where data from all clients is combined on a single server. However the theoretical aspects of the paper rely on specific scenarios and lack clarity. Strengths and Weaknesses  Strengths:  The work tackles an important and understudied aspect of FL: fairness.  The authors provide a rigorous mathematical definition of fairness (Demographic Parity).  Weaknesses:  The paper gives more attention to details in the appendix than in the main content making it difficult to understand.  The theoretical statements lack clarity and rely on specific use cases.  Some elements such as UFL (Uniform Fair Loss) are not fully explained and their significance is unclear.

The paper introduces two certification criteria: stateaction stability and a lower bound for cumulative reward. Three protocols are proposed for certification all using ensemble methods to aggregate subpolicy decisions. A treebased search approach is presented for certifying cumulative reward by evaluating all possible actions within a set. Experimental results on Freeway and Breakout games indicate that Freeway can be certified as robust to poisoning attacks with a significant poisoning threshold while Breakout cannot. The paper is generally wellwritten but there are some structural issues that could be addressed. Despite the critical nature of poisoning attacks in practical settings they remain understudied compared to testtime attacks. This work represents the first comprehensive proposal for certifying RL algorithms against poisoning attacks and the findings are promising. Specific Concerns and Questions: 1. Motivation for Multiple Protocols: The paper introduces three separate aggregation protocols for certification. However the results suggest that two of the protocols provide similar certification performance. To enhance readability it is recommended to present only one protocol and include the others in an appendix. 2. Subpolicy Quality and Dataset Size: Offline RL algorithms rely on finite datasets for training. Exploring the impact of varying the number of subpolicies (u) on subpolicy quality and certification performance would be beneficial. It is important to determine if increased u leads to higher subpolicy variance which could compromise certification. 3. DTPARL Window Size Variance: The DTPARL protocol considers varying window sizes. While the worstcase complexity is based on the maximum window size (Wmax) it would be informative to investigate the average window size and its impact on certification time. 4. Practical Certification Time: The paper claims that the certification time complexity per state is negligible compared to standard policy inference. Empirical evidence supporting this claim would be helpful as the complexity appears to be quadratic in the number of actions and linear in u. 5.

Weaknesses:  The paper presents data augmentation as a consequence of causality theory but this perspective offers no unique insights and the introduced structural causal model is not utilized in the method.  It conflates counterfactual reasoning with intervention. Altering states constitutes intervention not counterfactual reasoning (which refers to exploring hypothetical or unobserved conditions).

Unlike existing time series imputation techniques that primarily consider temporal relationships GRIN incorporates spatial relationships between time series by modeling them as nodes in a graph. The GRIN model employs a GNN to encode the data and perform two rounds of imputation. The GNN acts as gates within a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) capturing sequential information. This process is repeated for both forward and backward passes and a final MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) infers the missing values. Experiments demonstrate that GRIN outperforms baseline methods on various datasets. The papers strengths include its clarity and wellmotivated problem formulation. However it lacks references to matrix factorization methods that also address time series imputation and it does not explore the potential of forecasting time series with missing values as an alternative to imputation. The inclusion of backward dynamics in GRIN is intriguing as time typically progresses in a forward direction. Insights into the rationale for this design choice would be beneficial.

The aim is to force the encoder to assign the latent variables (z) in a way that the mapping will convert them into a manifold of a specific shape. Strengths:  The idea of adapting decoders is intriguing.  The mappings appear to be beneficial in most cases demonstrated in the experiments. Weaknesses:  The claim that the VAE prior is used for regularization is questioned. VAEs are not Bayesian models and the prior can be trained to fit the posterior distribution serving a different purpose.  The authors mention a figure (Fig. 3) on page 4 which disrupts the reading flow.  Its unclear why z is obtained by averaging y (z  g(\u03c8(\u03bc(\u03d5(x))))). Shouldnt it be z  g(\u03c8(y))  The calculation of the ELBO in Eq. 2 is questionable due to the use of g(\u03c8(y)).  The differentiation between the proposed method and using a specialized decoder with specific initial layers is not apparent.  The papers writing style is complex. It suggests that z are distinct random variables but they are not explicitly used in the objective function. This makes it challenging to follow the paper especially since the latent variables used in the ELBO are y.  The code provided does not fully clarify the papers missing elements.

It effectively compares to existing techniques. Weaknesses:  The presentation of the proposed framework InteLVAE could be improved.  The abstract concept of transforming Gaussian latent variables (g\u03c8) is not truly novel as it is merely a component of the decoder.  While the authors emphasize the shared use of g\u03c8 between the decoder and encoder technically g\u03c8 is still an integral part of the decoder.  The novelty of the paper lies more in the specific instances of g\u03c8 definitions such as the multimodal example presented in Appendix C.2. Suggestion: The paper should focus more on these specific g\u03c8 definitions rather than the broader concept of InteLVAE. For instance the multimodal g\u03c8 could be discussed in greater depth in the main text instead of being relegated to the appendix.", "Paraphrase: Summary This paper introduces a new approach to incorporate biases into variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enhance their representational capabilities.

It shows that CLIP can do well in a range of downstream applications and suggests ways to use the model. The experiments show that using CLIP for pretraining can lead to good performance and combining it with VL pretraining can achieve even better results than existing methods.

It looks at how different types of visual encoders affect the performance of the model.  The method achieves new stateoftheart results on several visionandlanguage tasks which could help future research in these areas. Weaknesses:  The paper does not clearly explain what advantages CLIP has over other VL pretraining techniques or how it achieves good results.  For a study that is focused on empirical analysis the paper could provide more indepth analysis instead of just presenting a collection of results.  When CLIP is compared to other VL pretraining techniques (e.g. Table 2 and Table 6) it seems to only be more effective when used with VL pretraining. This is complicated because the VL pretraining uses 9.18 million more samples. It is not clear if the methods improvements come from the advantages of CLIP or from using more external data.  The analysis on unfreezing the encoder is also problematic because it compares models without pretraining to models with VL pretraining. The higher accuracies of the latter models could be due to using more data rather than differences in the frozenfinetuned visual encoders.  CLIP seems to only work well with gridlike features extracted from convolutional neural networks and does not perform as well with regional features or when combined with a visual transformer.

The proposed technique is assessed in the Ant Maze and Ant Gather tasks exhibiting promising results in one experiment. Strengths and Weaknesses: This study addresses a significant research direction in reinforcement learning. However a few concerns and suggestions arise: 1. Missing Prior Work: The study omits a crucial prior work by Jain et al. (2019) which also applied ES to hierarchical learning. This prior work required less prior knowledge automatically learned the interface between the high and low levels and optimized the update frequency between them. This study sets these parameters manually. Additionally the prior work was validated on a physical robot while the current study is limited to simulation. A comprehensive analysis and quantitative comparison with Jain et al. (2019) would enhance the papers quality. 2. Limited Outperformance: The results do not show a significant advantage over the stateoftheart method HIRO. In the Ant Gather task the proposed algorithm achieves a slightly better result but at the cost of 60 times more training samples. In the Ant Maze task HIRO significantly outperforms the proposed method despite using only 160 samples. The study claims ES is more scalable however a direct comparison of training time (wall clock) between HIRO and ES would support this claim. 3. Terminology Confusion: The study repeatedly refers to policy gradient methods as \"MDP methods\" in the introduction. MDP is a problem formulation not a solution. This paper employs an MDP formulation but utilizes a derivativefree optimization solver. It appears the authors intended to use the term \"policy gradient methods\" that employ backpropagation for gradient calculation. 4. Visualization Improvement: In Figure 3 it would be beneficial to display the learning curves of all baseline methods in the same graph for ease of comparison. If the baseline curves are too short due to sample efficiency plotting them with wall clock time as the xaxis could be considered since the study argues that ES algorithms are more parallelizable and thus require less wall clock time for training.

They may have overlooked a potential issue in finding the appropriate index for a given permutation which can be computationally demanding. Robustness to Attacks:  The authors suggest that the worstcase attack on FSL involves inverting the order of rankings. However a more significant threat could be a coordinated attack across multiple layers of the network.  Algorithm 3 seems to imply that voting occurs only among malicious clients while stronger attacks may arise through consensusbased coordination among them.

The proposed architecture is a new combination of existing approaches and the results show that it performs well on the benchmark task.  The problem of designing flexible architectures that can learn locally (Hebbian) is theoretically and practically important especially for neuromorphic applications.

The claim that the proposed architecture is the first to use reinforcement learning with Poisson ratecoded inputs for image recognition and the first locallyconnected SNN with a hidden layer may not be true.  The paper seems very focused on the importance of developing spiking networks that are biologically plausible even though biological plausibility is not necessarily the primary goal of the computer vision field.

The approach trains neural networks to encode optical flow between sequential frames and includes a regularization term to ensure that the representation predicted by warping and a state transition model (based on action) closely matches the representation extracted from the subsequent frame. Advantages and Disadvantages: The approach is logical because prior research has shown the significance of object representation for efficient human learning in Atari games. Learning global representations may compromise detailed object information. While this work does not explicitly model objects the optical flow information probably captures some object features indirectly. The results are generally persuasive and the concept seems novel and intriguing. Concerns: However concerns exist about how the internal flow loss formulated in equation 4 contributes to feature extraction. To the best of our understanding the internal representations warping flow is identical to the picture warping flow (equation 2). This raises the question of how we can be certain that the extracted query feature is not simply a fixed linear translation of the local image region. It seems reasonable to assume that as long as the representation in equation 1 can be trained to estimate the external flow that minimizes the picture warping cost the cost of the internal flow will also be reduced. This remains true even if the query feature is a straightforward linear function of the local image region. Although the paper demonstrates strong performance in the RL task it would be beneficial to include visualizations of the learned local features in the appendix if possible.", "Paraphrase: Summary: This study investigates selfsupervised visual representation learning for reinforcement learning (RL). Instead of prior methods that focused on extracting global representations of current observations the authors propose learning \"structured\" representations using flow maps that capture local structure.

Strengths and Weaknesses: The paper is wellwritten and presents a novel approach to leveraging selfsupervised flow models for RL. However the results presented are not as strong as expected with mixed performance in Atari and limited superiority in Control Suite. Given the increased complexity and computational cost of the proposed method it may not be immediately practical for widespread adoption. RemarksQuestions:  The definition of \"structured representation\" is unclear and it is not clear if the proposed methods representations are genuinely more structured.  The claim that visual features representation learning leads to limited performance and sample efficiency should be refined as there is evidence of improvement using other methods.

This method is applied to train both the generative and inference processes of SGMs reformulating the generative modeling problem as an SB problem. Experiments were conducted using standard image datasets. Strengths:  Introduces a novel perspective on the SB problem through a nonlinear FeynmanKac representation of a partial differential equation (PDE) defining the SB optimal path measure.  Provides significant insight into practical SB solutions.  Generalizes the likelihoodbased training of scorebased generative models. Weaknesses:  Clarity needs improvement as the narrative is sometimes unclear and makes it difficult to understand the problem being solved.  Differences with prior work (e.g. iterative proportional fitting) are not sufficiently explained despite the proposed likelihood training of the forward and backward SDEs appearing similar.  Limitations are not adequately discussed such as the increased computational cost of training the inference process which is a key advantage of SGMs.  Convergence properties of the proposed method are not discussed leaving it unclear whether the likelihood training stage leads to convergence towards the SB solution. Detailed Comments and Questions:  The meaning of \"computing the loglikelihood objective of Schrodinger Bridge\" is ambiguous and requires clarification.  The \"model\" is not clearly defined until Section 3 and it took multiple readings to understand.  It is unclear why a more flexible framework would mitigate the instability problem mentioned in Section 2.1.  The order of the arguments of h in equation (11) may be incorrect.  Lemma 2 states that despite the randomness induced by Brownian motion the solution of the SDE y is a deterministic and smooth function. This is confusing as y is by nature random.  The notation in Theorem 3 is not introduced and requires clarification.  The practical benefits of the new interpretation of optimal control are not clear.  The comparison with other OT methods in Section 4.1 is not particularly meaningful as the SB problem is connected to entropyregularized OT rather than OT itself.

The authors need to verify if the FIMs used in experiments are indeed nonsingular.  Theorem 4:  The assumption of a fullrank Jacobian matrix in Theorem 4 requires further clarification.  The paper should provide an example of a twolayer neural network to illustrate how this assumption is met.  Meaning of D:  The meaning of D (number of input features) should be clarified.  The experiments should report the number of input features data points and neural network parameters.  Empirical FIM Approximations:  The empirical approximations of the FIM used in experiments may be insufficient.  The authors should explore the impact of varying the number of input features on NGDs performance.  Practical NGD with Damping:  The paper does not address the use of damping in practical NGD implementations.  The authors should discuss the impact of damping on NGDs inductive bias.

It specifically focuses on natural gradient descent (NGD) which is independent of parameterization. This enables the study of parameterizations role in generalization using gradient descent and the examination of inductive biases inherent to NGD. The study considers two distinct scenarios: separable classification using deep linear models and matrix completion using deep matrix factorization.

The paper is wellorganized clearly written and the proofs and theorems are presented effectively.  The background on parameterizations influence on generalization in separable classification and matrix completion is thorough. Weaknesses:  While studying NGD as a tool to understand parameterizations impact in generalization is original the parametertohypothesis mapping is already welldefined in the two scenarios studied.  The paper could benefit from discussing potential insights gained from this perspective or exploring less wellunderstood settings.  The significance of the theoretical contributions in Section 3 could be emphasized and discussed in more detail indicating implications for comprehending NGD in general settings.

In the proof of \"Invariance of NGF under reparametrization\" \\mathcalP(\\dotwt) should likely be \\dot\\theta.  In Theorem 4 the phrase \"the Jacobi matrix\" should be corrected to \"Jacobian.\"  Consider referencing the recent work on \"Kernel and Rich Regimes in Overparametrized Models\" in the discussion on parameterization initialization and implicit biases.", "Paraphrased Summary: This research examines the inherent bias of natural gradient flow (NGF) in certain types of neural networks. The authors demonstrate that NGF solutions for empirical risk minimization are unaffected by pixel reordering. They also show that NGF does not share the property of Euclidean gradient descent which produces solutions with minimal L2 norms under logistic loss (Theorem 12). Additionally they introduce an improved NGF algorithm for deep diagonal linear networks.

The authors employ reparameterization invariance properties of NGD to isolate the effects of the solution identified by gradient descent from the parameterization used. The study focuses on gradient flow dynamics in two specific scenarios: separable classification under logistic loss and deep matrix factorization. The paper claims to identify situations where NGD fails to generalize while standard gradient descent (GD) with suitable architecture succeeds. Strengths and Weaknesses: The central theme of the paper is to leverage NGD properties to investigate its inductive bias. However there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the interpretation of \"reparametrization invariance\" applied to NGD. The general description of NGD in Section 2.3 appears sound. The authors correctly state that \"NGD with infinitesimal learning rate (i.e. NGF) always follows the same trajectory in model space and finds the same optimum irrespective of how it is parametrized provided that the parametrization is smooth and locally invertible.\" However the authors subsequent analysis involves parameterization changes that do not qualify as reparameterizations. For instance in Section 3 the comparison of \u03b2w versus \u03b2w1\u2299\u22ef\u2299wL alters the dimension of the parameter space from D to L\u00d7D which is not considered a reparameterization that ensures optimization equivalence under NGD. Similarly in Section 4 the parameterization of \u03b2 (with dimension D\u00d7D) using matrices Wi (with dimension L\u00d7D\u00d7D) of varying depths constitutes a distinct model architecture rather than a reparameterization. The authors analysis seems to equate \"parameterization\" differences between ResNet50 ResNet101 and VisionTransformer when applied to ImageNet classification tasks with actual architectural differences. Without establishing a connection between optimization and architectural variations the significance of this analysis remains unclear. For example in Figure 5 of Section 4 where the authors highlight a situation where NGD fails to generalize while GD with L2 and L3 performs well it is unclear if they are demonstrating the inadequacy of L1 for matrix completion tasks (which is an obvious limitation) rather than a failure of NGD per se. The authors should clarify whether NGD was also tested with L2 and L3 and if so whether it exhibited nongeneralization behavior. While the paper acknowledges that C and D yield the same solution in Figure 2 which is noteworthy further elaboration on how reparametrization invariance applies to the studied models would be beneficial. Additionally the justification for the full rank of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) should be provided. Addressing these concerns could strengthen the papers arguments and clarify its claims.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: This paper explores the \"inductive bias\" of natural gradient flow a training algorithm for deep learning models.

To address this researchers have developed neural GAM (NODEGAM) and neural GA2M (NODEGA2M) which maintain interpretability while scaling well on large datasets and outperforming other GAMs. Previous approaches like NODE while mimicking decision trees lack interpretability.

Using a consistent logit layer to eliminate feature interactions. 3. Avoiding DenseNet connections between trees focused on different features. Experiments on binary classification and regression datasets demonstrate that NODEGA2M performs comparably to stateoftheart methods. Semisupervised learning capabilities are also evaluated indicating the models ability to learn from unlabeled data and finetune on limited labeled data.

The selfsupervised model figures out group codes based on how words are positioned in the hidden space that is made when predicted codes are switched between different versions of the same sentence. They also add a weighting term to this loss function that makes sure the predictions from different embedding spaces are balanced which results in a similar space for both the source and target languages. They test their method on both the Wmt14 dataset and the lowresource FLoRes dataset and get the best BLEU scores ever for unsupervised machine translation. Strengths:  The authors suggest a new method that works across languages to mine synthetic parallel data from current monolingual corpora in various languages.  Adapting the computer vision SwAV loss function to finetune masked language models in natural language processing.  Using a balanced weighting method to force even cluster assignment regardless of language (when using separate masked language models) resulting in a shared embedding space.  Their tSNE plots clearly show the languageagnostic embedding space where sentences from various languages with similar meanings are near one another.  The suggested method eliminates the need for pretraining on a sizable multilingual parallel dataset. Weaknesses:  The authors give a set of filtering rules to eliminate poor samples from the initial mined dataset. The filtering criteria depend mostly on predefined thresholds such as sourcetarget length ratio and subword overlap which require adjustment for each language pair to produce satisfactory results. A metaclassifier might be trained using a limited clean sourcetarget dataset to prevent perlanguage adjustment eliminating the need for it.

The effectiveness of the additional learning capacity (parameter updates) allocated to the selection network and second policy is questionable. Its possible that allocating this capacity to a single policy could be more efficient.  The experiments were conducted in environments with essentially two tasks which may explain the success of the twopolicy approach. Its uncertain how it would perform in environments with more complex task combinations.  The method resembles the \"options\" framework but the similarities and differences are not adequately discussed.  Its unclear what occurs in the \"adaptive SACI\" scenario: whether theres an additional network estimating a weight and if so what its loss function is.  SAC is not necessarily the most advanced RL method so the choice of using it as a foundation is questionable.  The motivation for the approach and its implementation are applicable to various RL techniques not just SAC.

It partitions the data trains a model and uses the demographic shift description to estimate the models fairness after deployment with high confidence. Shifty returns models that are guaranteed to be fair after deployment with a probability of at least 1  \u03b4.

Two approaches are presented: one for known distribution shifts and one for unknown shifts. They tested SHIFTY on a student success prediction dataset and compared it to existing fairness methods. Strengths and Weaknesses SHIFTY addresses a critical problem. Its parallel approach for candidate selection and confidence bound estimation is innovative. However the selection process for the different data distributions (training and deployment) is unclear potentially affecting the representativeness of the samples. The authors claim to allow users to customize fairness measures but its unclear how they address individual fairness. They also acknowledge that their assumption of independent parameter intervals is often invalid. SHIFTYs reliance on userprovided distribution shift information is an inherent limitation. Additionally training models for multiple unknown distribution shifts significantly impacts performance. The evaluation section is not fully convincing as the comparison with nonfairnessfocused methods for different distributions is questionable. The results for unknown distribution shifts suggest that the Seldonian algorithm outperforms SHIFTY. It is recommended that the authors compare SHIFTY with methods designed for concept shift and include additional datasets for evaluation to ensure consistency across different contexts.", "Paraphrase: This paper introduces algorithms that ensure fairness when the data used for deployment differs in demographic characteristics (e.g. gender or race) compared to the data used for training.

Experiments on a dataset related to academic performance demonstrate that the approach effectively reduces the likelihood of creating biased classifiers.

This approach suggests that empirical risk minimization using a suitable surrogate loss would lead to a hypothesis with a low population risk. The paper develops tools and presents two key findings: 1. Fully connected neural networks can approximate Boolean circuits with a small sample size that is polynomial in the number of gates and logarithmic in the circuits width and depth. 2. Transformers can approximate Turing machines with a sample size that is polynomial in the number of states alphabet size and logarithmic in the computation steps.

The paper demonstrates that certain surrogate losses (e.g. alllayer margin loss) can lead neural networks to prefer learning simple classes of functions with limited samples. This is notable because different network structures may require different surrogate losses. Concerns:  Some argue that SM approximation is not surprising because it is possible to construct a surrogate loss that assigns infinite loss to functions outside a specified class.

Subsequently existing spectral clustering techniques are applied to the graphonbased distance matrix. The theoretical properties of these approaches are thoroughly analyzed and their consistency is demonstrated under specific smoothness assumptions about the underlying graphon. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths:  Handles the challenge of vertex correspondence: Unlike existing methods that assume vertexmatched graphs this paper directly tackles the issue of clustering graphs without known vertex correspondences.  Theoretical guarantees: The proposed clustering algorithms and testing framework are supported by theoretical guarantees. Weaknesses:  Limitations of the Bernoulli exchangeable model: The paper utilizes the Bernoulli exchangeable model for graph estimation which only accommodates dense graphs. This model may not be suitable for realworld networks that are typically sparse.

The authors first present a theoretical bound on performance for an averagecase DG formulation followed by experiments that examine the tradeoff between model complexity and outofdistribution (OOD) performance. These experiments illustrate the existence of such tradeoffs for linear models and suggest the tradeoff also applies to shallow neural networks. Strengths  Problem setting: The setting is relevant as recent findings indicate most DG algorithms are unable to outperform empirical risk minimization (ERM).  Insights from Theorem 1: Treating environments as data is an intriguing concept enabling the derivation of a bound that is agnostic to the form of \\mathcalE. Further analysis may yield insights when \\mathcalE has a specific structure or the hypothesis class is linear.  Accuracy vs. complexity: The experiments in Section 3.1 provide valuable insights. The findings suggest that \"the optimal regularization for [DG] is stronger than for [supervised learning].\" This implies that DG methods require stricter control over model complexity than regular supervised learning.

Typos: There are several typos including inconsistencies in spelling (e.g. \"regularizers\" and \"regularisation\").

This paper delves into the reasons behind this phenomenon focusing on model complexity. It proposes that effective OOD generalization requires models with lower complexity. Thus DG methods can leverage crossdomain validation to optimize models for better generalization. Strengths:  Provides a generalization bound for the DG setting.  Empirical evidence supports the notion that OOD generalization benefits from lower model complexity.  Presents crossdomain validation as a useful metric for optimizing DG models. Weaknesses:  The paper does not address the small sample size (n) often observed in practice.  It overemphasizes model complexity as the primary factor influencing DG results. Additional Feedback:  The generalization bound could be extended to incorporate insights from papers exploring the role of regularization in OOD generalization.  The conclusion regarding regularization is not particularly novel.  The discussion following Theorem 2 overlooks the challenges of empirical DG where ERM may struggle with large domain shifts.  The empirical results demonstrate that model complexity is a contributing factor to OOD accuracy but not the sole determinant.

However the paper could be improved in the following ways:  The rationale for generating perturbations in salient areas needs more support and justification. Salient objects may frequently include smooth lowfrequency areas (e.g. human skin) making them less suited for perturbation generation.  It is unclear if generating disruptions in salient object regions is more effective than doing so in highfrequency or textured areas.

Unlike previous approaches it explicitly incorporates structural relationships between state features observations rewards and actions in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). By constructing a generative environment model (SSVAE) the proposed method learns these relationships and the corresponding ASRs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in conjunction with both modelfree and modelbased RL approaches in environments like VizDoom and CarRacing. Strengths:  The paper introduces a novel approach that leverages structural constraints in MDPs for state representation learning.  Both the structural constraints and ASRs are learned jointly from trajectory data.  ASRs are evaluated with both modelfree and modelbased RL algorithms.  The learned structure provides insights and has the potential for interpretable representation. Weaknesses:  The methodology could be improved for clarity.  The relationship between SSVAE and similar models like RSSM used in other reinforcement learning methods is not thoroughly discussed.  The choice of experimental environments and specific settings is not adequately explained. Major Concerns with the Methodology:  The definition of ASR under the condition of maximizing cumulative reward needs clarification.  The rationale for neglecting the first term in maximizing mutual information is unclear.  The computation of crossentropy H(qp) given the different distribution types of q and p is not fully explained.  The derivation and motivation for using a lower bound to minimize the conditional mutual information should be provided.  The exact process of obtaining the actiondependent ASR from the estimated structural matrices is not described.

The absence of DeepMind Control Suite environments in the experiments which are commonly used for highdimensional state representation learning raises questions about the generalizability of the results.

Interpretation of graph structure variables: The interpretation of the binary graph structure variables D is unclear as the Gaussian section suggests they represent both connection and connection strength.

By leveraging an offline dataset skills can be extracted and used as a foundation for reinforcement learning algorithms increasing sample efficiency and enabling direct application to challenging robotic tasks. The authors propose a graphical model with four variables at each time step:  xt: MDP state  yt: Discrete skill selector  zt: Continuous skill parameters  at: Output of the selected skill (e.g. robot joint velocities) The model is learned using variational inference and then refined through reinforcement learning optimizing the skill selector parameters and execution. The model incorporates information asymmetry where each level of the hierarchy has a different perception of the state.

Experiments show that for complex manipulation tasks with minimal rewards convergence is more likely with only the highlevel controller. This approach provides added versatility and may facilitate the learning of more complex tasks compared to prior methods using only two levels. Strengths and Weaknesses:  Advantage: The proposed system allows for advantageous transfer by modifying only the highlevel controller.  Advantage: Retraining the midlevel controller across different modalities may be feasible since different levels operate on various aspects of the state space.  Strength: Comprehensive experimental section includes comparisons with alternative methods and ablation studies.  Strength: Two transfer learning variants are tested: one with highlevel controller retraining only (HeLMScat) and one with both highlevel and midlevel retraining (HeLMSmix). HeLMScat appears more beneficial in complex cases with minimal rewards.  Strength: Compared to alternatives HeLMS explores a wider state space leading to higher rewards when rewards are minimal. It combines highlevel exploration with known skills.  Question: HeLMSmixs diminishing reward in complex tasks could be due to spurious correlations but this is not observed in other methods.

Specific criteria should be established.  The four main features are body posture animal color block shape and background color. Their data type and distribution (continuous or discrete) should be clarified.  The phrase \"legs position\" is ambiguous. A precise measurement or visualization is needed to define its values.

By evaluating models on transformed inputs the authors find that ViTs maintain stability and identify these features as useful but not robust. To address this they propose patchbased negative augmentation and losses which consistently enhance ViT robustness. Strengths:  The observation that ViTs remain stable despite significant transformations is intriguing.  The study provides thorough comparisons to support these findings.  Negative data augmentations are not widely used in vision transformers so their application in this context is novel and promising. Weaknesses:  The loss function comprises three components: uniform loss L2 loss and contrastive loss. While accuracies are compared there is no clear determination of the optimal loss or their specific differences. This uncertainty detracts from the papers contribution regarding the three losses.  Experiments focus primarily on the original ViT or versions augmented with RandAug and AugMix. Given that the proposed negative augmentation complements positive augmentations it is crucial to evaluate its performance with more advanced models like DeiT which employs a positive training strategy.  The experiments use ViTs with 16x16 token inputs. It is unclear whether transformers using finergrained token representations (e.g. 8x8) would yield different results and how varying the scale of patch augmentation affects the outcomes.  Recent advances in vision transformers have introduced modifications to tokenization including multiscale and overlapping embeddings. It is not known whether the high confidence predictions for unrecognizable images arise from ViTs nonoverlapping token embeddings. Furthermore the study does not examine whether the proposed augmentations are applicable to transformer architectures with overlapping embeddings.", "Paraphrase: This study examines the resilience of vision transformers (ViTs). It reveals that ViTs rely heavily on characteristics that persist after patchbased alterations but often lack humanrecognizable semantic significance. However these characteristics are susceptible to manipulation. The authors suggest utilizing patchbased conversions as \"negatively augmented views\" and provide penalties to discourage the use of nonrobust characteristics during training. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that patchbased negative augmentation consistently enhances ViT robustness. Strengths:  The research innovatively identifies that ViTs utilize characteristics that are not always semantically meaningful for humans.  Experiments validate the studys hypothesis and the proposed patchbased negative augmentation successfully boosts robustness. Weaknesses:  The study focuses on ViT resilience without investigating its impact on other vision transformer models or realworld applications.", "Summary Paraphrase: This study investigates how vision transformers (ViTs) handle image augmentations that drastically alter the images meaning. The researchers show that ViTs can perform well on ImageNet even with severely distorted test images due to patchbased transformations (Pcorrupted). However this adaptation to robustness against patchbased changes compromises their ability to generalize to unrelated datasets (OutofDistribution OoD).

Simple intuitive and effective negative augmentation methods.  Extensive testing to determine optimal hyperparameters and demonstrate method effectiveness.  Compatibility of negative augmentation with positive augmentation and larger datasets.  Wellwritten and clear presentation.

The authors propose using patch transformations as negative augmentations in ViT training to enhance resilience paralleling human perception. They implement three loss functions to prevent overly confident ViT predictions on transformed images. The authors validate their findings through experiments on ImageNet series datasets. Strengths:  The concept is straightforward and comprehensible.  The explanations and illustrations are clear.  The experiments are welldesigned and their parameters are transparent. Weaknesses:  The study concludes that the method significantly improves ViTs outofdistribution performance but the results indicate limited improvements for two of the three losses (Uniform and L2).  Only the contrastive loss yields substantial enhancements. However its known for effectively training models through metric learning promoting compact representations in feature spaces. Thus the specific contribution of the contrastive loss within the proposed method is unclear.  A baseline with contrastive loss should be evaluated using only clean or positively augmented images for training.  Figure 2 doesnt support the claim that ViTs are insensitive to patch transformations. The authors have exaggerated the vertical axis scale to minimize the perceived changes.

Strengths and Weaknesses:  The new definition of hierarchical structures is valuable and applies to many realworld HRL scenarios.  The development of theoretical understanding in HRL is still limited and this paper could be a significant step forward. However several concerns arise:  The assumptions made in the paper are numerous and not commonly used in the field. The authors should explain why each assumption is essential and whether they restrict the applicability of the algorithms.  Some assumptions appear artificial and may not hold in most HRL situations such as Assumption 5.2.  The paper should provide more information about the magnitude of the parameters used in the assumptions such as those in Assumption 6.1.  The algorithm proposed in Section 5 for learning transition dynamics and exit detection is not explicitly compared to the bruteforce approach. It would be helpful to clarify the benefits of the new algorithm.  The regret bound in Theorem 6.2 does not include the cost of learning the hierarchy.

Comparison to Prior Work: The authors should highlight the significant differences between TAViT and prior works that addressed taskagnostic learning in federated learning.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: The paper proposes an architecture for image processing that divides a network into head body and tail components. The head and tail components are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and can be trained on multiple devices using federated learning (FedAvg). The body component is based on transformers and is trained on a central server. The head and tail components are taskspecific while the body component is taskagnostic and learns from clients representing different tasks. The experimental results show comparable or superior performance to nondistributed models as well as outperforming purely federated learning (FL) and serveronly learning (SL) approaches with a low number of clients. Strengths and Weaknesses: The paper is wellwritten and proposes a novel architecture for distributed multitask learning. The code and models are available making it easy to implement. However there are some key omissions that limit the papers impact:  Privacy Guarantees: Despite mentioning \"privacypreserving\" in the title the paper lacks any discussion of privacy guarantees for the proposed architecture. Privacy protection is crucial in federated learning and should be rigorously addressed.  Communication Cost: The paper does not discuss the communication costs associated with federated learning in the context of the proposed architecture. Transmitting gradients between clients and the server can significantly impact performance and scalability.  Choice of Architectures and Sampling Strategy: The rationale behind choosing CNNs for the head and tail components and transformers for the body component is not adequately explained. Additionally the sampling strategy of selecting exactly one client from each task may not scale well with a larger number of clients.  Diversity of Experiments: The validation experiments mainly focus on a particular architecture. To establish the frameworks generalization more diverse experiments could be conducted.  Revised Response: The authors have significantly improved the paper by addressing most of the concerns raised in the comments. The addition of Section 3.3 and Appendix D provides explanations for the architectural choices and privacy guarantees. The remaining unresolved reference in the \"Federated Learning\" paragraph on page 3 is a minor typographical error.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: This research aims to develop a privacypreserving method for training neural networks in image processing tasks such as deblocking denoising removing rain and blurring. The method involves splitting the neural network model into two parts: taskspecific convolutional head and tails (trained on local devices or \"clients\") and a common Transformerbased backbone (trained on a central server). The headtails and backbone are trained alternately assuming the other component is constant. This approach is similar to \"SplitFed\" but extends it to multiple tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method:  Successfully trains neural network models.  Achieves comparable or slightly better performance compared to existing distributed privacypreserving methods.  Performs better using the Transformerbased backbone compared to CNN backbones and in a multitask setting compared to singletask training. Strengths:  The method effectively extends \"SplitFed\" to multitask learning with a shared backbone on the server side.  The experiments demonstrate the viability of the method and its ability to achieve comparable performance to existing privacypreserving methods.  Joint multitask training shows some performance synergy on various tasks. Weaknesses:  The use of a Transformerbased backbone on the server is not a unique contribution compared to prior work. The key novelty lies in jointly training a shared backbone on different tasks which is a natural extension of previous methods.  The choice of using CNNs as headtails and a Transformer as a backbone is not fully explained or justified. It is unclear if the roles could be reversed without impacting performance.

The approach leverages the scaled Bregman divergence and can be recast as a multiclass logistic regression problem. By adapting the concept of telescoping the proposed method alleviates the density chasm issue and outperforms other methods in various datasets. Strengths:  The method is clearly motivated and theoretically robust.  The paper is straightforward.  The proposed method significantly outperforms other approaches particularly when both false outofdomain (FOD) and highoutofdomain (HOD) density chasm issues arise. Limitations:  The novelty of the method appears incremental as both Lemma 1 and the telescoping concept are existing ideas.  If the support of the two densities is entirely disjoint estimating the density ratio becomes trivial (yielding 0 or infinity).  If one density is a simple translation (mean shift) of the other and they are wellseparated logistic regression may provide better classification due to improved separation. This may contradict the claimed FOD challenge. Clarification from the authors would be helpful.  The majority of experiments are focused on normal (Gaussian) distributions.

This approach utilizes the random feature concept introduced by Rahimi and Recht where each random feature is calculated as the activation function of a randomly weighted inner product between the input and a random vector. To enhance efficiency the authors impose constraints on the random vector and activation function. They restrict these elements to have values between 0 and 1 allowing for computation with only additions and subtractions (avoiding multiplications) and reducing storage requirements by storing only 1 bit per feature. Under specific assumptions the authors prove that their kernel approximation converges to the true kernel as the number of features and data points increases to infinity.

GrASP employs two expansion procedures: shallowdepth complete trees and Upper Confidence Tree (UCT)based Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It compares its performance to TD3 and different variants of GrASP on tasks from the DM Control Suite. Strengths:  Offers a comprehensive ablation analysis of GrASP with both shallowdepth complete trees and UCTbased MCTS.  Extends the Valueequivalent model with an affordance learning module.  Provides a qualitative analysis of switches between affordance mapping outputs.  Episode returns for GrASP variants tend to be positively skewed when they outperform baseline models. Weaknesses:  The claim of introducing the concept of affordances for planning in continuous domains is inconsistent as Sampled MuZero is mentioned in related work as a previous approach. GrASP differs from MuZero by using gradients and a discrete set of affordance mappings for tree construction. However the paper does not clarify how this discrete set is determined from the continuous action and state space which may involve environmentspecific design choices.  GrASP is not compared to other stateoftheart (SOTA) modelbased algorithms. While the authors acknowledge that GrASP is not the SOTA it makes it difficult to assess its contribution.  The comparison between GrASP and Dreamer in the Appendix is relevant but some observations appear inconsistent with the provided plots. For instance Dreamer performs better than GrASP on Walkerwalk and CheetahRun. A discussion comparing the relative merits of the two models would enhance the analysis.  The result section emphasizes which GrASP variants perform well in different scenarios but it does not provide a clear conclusion regarding the best model or its taskenvironmenthyperparameter dependencies.  The claim that GrASP fails to improve over TD3 in CartpoleSwingup is incomplete as one GrASP variant initially learns faster than TD3 although TD3 eventually achieves a higher asymptotic performance in ReachEasy and WalkerWalk. Minor Issue:  The term \"root note node\" is unclear. Clarification: Comparing discrete steps in TD3 and GrASP: In TD3 a step is a single transition while in GrASP the continuation of the tree expansion procedure is typically considered a step. The action selection in GrASP is performed at the leaf nodes of the search tree which can have varying depths depending on the selected expansion procedure. In contrast TD3 executes an action for every transition (step).", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: The paper presents a novel approach to tackle continuous action space planning with tree search algorithms by utilizing affordance learning. The proposed architecture comprises multiple modules with one module specifically designed to expand the search tree by predicting a set of discrete affordances (possible actions) for each state node. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in handling complex tasks where conventional tree search methods may struggle. Strengths:  The idea of affordance learning is innovative and has potential implications for improving the capabilities of agents in complex decisionmaking scenarios.  The paper is wellwritten and accessible to readers with a basic understanding of reinforcement learning (RL). Weaknesses:  It is unclear what prevents the affordance prediction module from generating similar actions potentially limiting exploration and optimization.  The initialization of the affordance prediction model may significantly impact its performance and further clarification on its role is needed.  The gradient update process for the affordance module considers only a limited number of affordances raising concerns about thorough exploration of the action space.

Novelty: The paper offers new insights into the convergence behavior of LSR with SGD. It suggests that an appropriate LSR can reduce variance and enhance convergence speed.

The authors should provide more guidance or empirical evidence regarding this threshold.  Estimation of T1: Accurately estimating the number of epochs for LSR (T1) is crucial for TSLAs performance. Underestimating T1 can lead to worse results than applying no LSR while overestimating it can prolong training time. Finding the optimal T1 may be a demanding task.  Sensitivity to Hyperparameters: Empirical results indicate that TSLAs performance is sensitive to the choice of the hyperparameter \u03b8.

The assault consists of three steps: 1) identifying the most important tokens for inference efficiency 2) creating adversarial perturbations for these tokens and 3) choosing the perturbations with the greatest impact.

The approach to identifying significant tokens could be relevant to other areas of research such as the over and undertranslation of NMT. Weaknesses:  The paper emphasizes the relationship between NMT efficiency and output length. However it would be beneficial to quantify the change in output length after the adversarial attacks. Output length is a more direct measure of NMT efficiency and is hardwareindependent.  A straightforward solution to the attack could involve applying constraints to the beam search process of NMT. For instance decoding could be terminated when the output reaches twice the length of the input. If a simple constraint can mitigate the attack the contribution of the paper would be diminished.

Motivation: GPbased methods excel at preventing catastrophic forgetting by preserving weights crucial to previous tasks.

This can result in insufficient learning of new tasks (intransigence) and reduced ability to benefit from previously learned knowledge (backward transfer). Proposed Solution: TRGP overcomes this issue by introducing a scaling matrix Q that allows for selective unfreezing of weights within \"Trust Regions.\" These regions are defined as the most correlated subspaces from previous tasks to the current task.

Helpful inclusion of a proof sketch in the main text.  Comprehensive related work section. Weaknesses  Mathematical errors: The proofs contain several inaccuracies that invalidate the main result. Specifically the authors incorrectly manipulate the expectation formula leading to incorrect complexity estimates.  Restrictive parameter assumptions: The theorem assumptions impose strong conditions on the number of workers and local steps making them impractical in certain scenarios.  Numerical experiments: The evaluation is conducted with only 2 workers which is insufficient to demonstrate parallel speedup. Additionally the batch sizes used for local and nonlocal methods are not equal compromising the fairness of the comparison. General Comments  The statement \"local steps ensure communication efficiency\" is not entirely accurate as there are cases where local updates may not improve efficiency.  Table 1 requires revisions to include missing information and correct complexity bounds.  The paper should cite related work on scalable federated optimization methods.

This paper provides a theoretical analysis of local gradient clipping and shows that it can guarantee convergence when the number of workers and local iterations are limited. While local gradient clipping is a practical approach it has some limitations. The theoretical results require that the number of workers and the number of local iterations be kept small.

It refutes the claim that weight inheritance is unnecessary. The authors present evidence that previous experiments lacked appropriate learning rates and training epochs preventing network convergence.

Figure 2 shows an increase in mean JSV which does not imply improved DI (as DI theory aims for mean JSV around 1). 3. The comparison against scratch training appears biased. Finetuning is typically performed for a shorter duration than training from scratch but in this work finetuning was carried out for a similar number of epochs. The scratch version could potentially be optimized to yield better performance. 4. The use of L2 regularization on pruned weights to enhance DI recovery is not adequately justified.", "Paraphrase: Summary Research exists that casts doubt on the value of inheriting network weights when pruning structured neural networks as training from scratch is often found to produce comparable or better results than finetuning pruned models. This paper contributes three main components: 1. The authors reexamine the problem and argue that the previous conclusion is flawed due to undersized finetuning learning rates. They demonstrate that finetuning with pruned weights outperforms training from scratch when larger learning rates and extended training epochs are used. 2. The authors utilize dynamical isometry (DI) to analyze the impact of finetuning learning rate on final performance. They show that weight pruning disrupts DI which finetuning can restore. Notably higher learning rates accelerate the recovery of DI. 3. They propose a method to fully restore DI prior to finetuning in filter pruning. Strengths and Weaknesses Strengths  The paper presents a wellorganized and detailed study.  It effectively investigates the impact of learning rate on the finetuning stage of pruning filling a critical gap in previous research. Weaknesses  The concept of initialization in pruning is not fully clarified. While pruning in the provided figure may refer to weight pruning for both networks filter pruning results in distinct architectures making the pruned results different rather than alternate initializations for the same architecture.  The relationship between DI and generalization is not explicitly established. Other metrics such as flatness could potentially exhibit similar trends to DI. Including a comparison with additional generalization metrics would enhance the persuasiveness of the analysis.  The experiments on MLP7 and MNIST may be overly simplistic for practical applications.

The method utilizes denoised smoothing to generate adversaryresistant versions of compromised models with the goal of detecting adversarial examples that trigger the identified backdoors.  Human trials demonstrate that the patches associated with these triggers are visible and easily detected by humans. Weaknesses:  The presented threat model is somewhat contrived.

Human judgment is used to identify patterns in adversarial examples of the denoised classifier. These patterns are then extracted and modified to match the original trigger patches. Concerns:  The denoised classifier has a smaller certified radius than the one trained from scratch.  The \u03b5perturbations used in the paper are relatively large.

Instead of matching distribution risks as frequently done in the past they propose training models using data point mixtures to prevent reliance on false correlations between domain and class labels. These correlations may not hold during testing. The suggested approach employs the concept of mixup blending data instances in two ways: combining data points from the same class but different domains and combining data points from the same domain but distinct classes. Strengths:  The approach is efficient and adaptable readily incorporable into existing techniques.  Benchmark tests demonstrate improved prediction performance compared to baseline methods. Weaknesses and Recommendations:  The approach relies on assumptions not discussed in the manuscript such as the assumption that domaininvariant approaches can only improve generalization if dataconditional label distributions remain consistent across domains.  The evaluation focuses solely on downstream performance improvements providing limited insight into the sources of improvement. The authors should conduct domain prediction experiments to assess the invariance of learned representations.  The authors claim that the proposed mixup strategies induce domain invariance but this has not been empirically verified. They could evaluate risk estimates across domains to confirm this claim.  The evaluation should include an investigation into the effects of model capacity as the authors speculate that regularizers may limit model capacity and hinder performance.  The risk bounds in Theorems 1 and 2 rely on highly simplistic assumptions limiting their practical relevance.  The proposed approach bears similarities to recent methods that employ mixup across domains. The related work section should address these parallels. Other Comments:  The setting described on page 2 was first introduced in [6] not by Koh et al. (2021).  The labeled mixup definition in Eq. 2 assumes onehot encoding which is not explicitly stated.

Data distributions are represented as mixtures of distributions (domains) and two distribution shift scenarios are addressed: 1. Domain shift where training and testing domains are mutually exclusive. 2. Subpopulation shift where the test distribution has different mixture proportions than the training distribution. It is assumed that domain identification has a spurious (false) correlation with labels. To address this two mixup strategies are proposed:  Mixup: Combine two examples with the same label but from different domains.  Antimixup: Combine two examples with the same domain but different labels. It is argued that these mixup strategies counteract the spurious correlations. Experiments demonstrate the methods effectiveness compared to standard risk minimization (ERM) and other augmentation methods.

The authors designed four training scenarios that vary the relevance of certain features:  Cue conflict: Features are relevant to the task.  Zero shot: Irrelevant features are present.  Partial exposure: Irrelevant features are present but only a subset is used for training. The testing scenario involves extrapolating to a setting where all features are relevant. The inductive bias of a learning system is determined by the difference in its extrapolation performance under different training conditions. The authors evaluated their framework on synthetic and realworld datasets. On a synthetic 2D dataset they found that generalized linear models favor rulebased generalization while Gaussian processes favor exemplarbased generalization.

This method uses features from different levels and views of images to obtain more consistent features compared to traditional Contrastive Learning (CL) that only employs features from final layers. HCCLs effectiveness has been demonstrated in tasks such as classification detection segmentation and fewshot learning. While previous approaches have partially explored the concept of representation consistency across views and layers they often relied on direct consistency loss between feature pairs. However in practice features often exhibit only partial similarity between the last few layers. This requires careful selection of layers and parameters for optimal performance. HCCL addresses this limitation by introducing transformation modules that bridge compared features.

LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to fullmodel finetuning while requiring only a small number of additional parameters (0.010.05 of the original model). Crucially LoRAs training is efficient without incurring additional computational costs during inference. The core idea of LoRA is to learn a set of lowrank parameters that are added to the original LM parameters instead of finetuning every parameter. Specifically LoRA involves: 1. Freezing the original LM parameters. 2. Creating a parallel set of lowrank parameters (WBA) for each original parameter. 3. Training the model by updating only the lowrank parameters which are used to compute hidden states (Eq. 3). 4. Testing the model using the new parameters computed as W0  BA avoiding extra computations. Evaluations on both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks demonstrate that LoRA outperforms other efficient finetuning methods and often even fullmodel finetuning. Notably LoRA uses a minuscule number of parameters compared to the original model. Additionally LoRAs inference overhead is minimal compared to other techniques that require further computations. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths:  Novel approach of using parallel lowrank paths for efficient finetuning.  Eliminates additional computations during inference.  Optimized training process.

The authors show that by adding a small number of these extra parameters the model can perform well on different tasks. Strengths:  Simple and efficient method for adapting large pretrained models.  Good performance compared to other finetuning approaches. Weaknesses:  The idea is similar to other methods like adapters.  Its not compared to the latest and greatest models.

The paper is wellwritten and accessible providing solid experimental evidence to support its claims. Strengths:  Clear and comprehensible writing style.  The paper builds upon the established ELECTRA architecture making its main contribution the addition of an inductive learning curriculum easily identifiable.  The authors employ multiple auxiliary MLMs and strategically combine their outputs to feed the discriminative text encoder.  To optimize training efficiency and streamline the architecture all auxiliary MLMs are derived from a single base MLM with subMLMs generated from different layers.  The mixture parameter is learned adversarially using the negative discriminator gradient.  The extensive ablation study provides empirical support for the proposed architectures superiority.

Similar to ELECTRA which uses a masked language model (MLM) as a generator to corrupt input text with masked tokens this method employs multiple MLM generators that replace tokens at varying difficulty levels. A discriminator model is then trained to identify the replaced tokens. The authors use gumblesoftmax to enable gradient flow from the discriminator to the multiple generators. Evaluation: The results on GLUE and Squad show that the proposed approach outperforms previous stateoftheart methods. Questions: 1. It appears that the generator with more layers (8) achieves a lower training loss during pretraining implying that it can better recover masked tokens and create a more challenging task for the discriminator. 2. Is the MLM head shared across different generator layers 3. The ablation study on stopgradient is limited to MNLI and Squad tasks which are expected to exhibit performance degradation. Is this ablation evaluated on other GLUE tasks as well 4. The authors use gumblesoftmax to enable gradient propagation. Is it possible to leverage reinforcement learning for this purpose as in ELECTRA and what is the impact on downstream task performance 5. The authors state that the discriminator loss is used to train the mixture weights of MLM output to create a more challenging signal for the discriminator but this process does not update the MLM embeddings. This seems contradictory as the generator is jointly trained with the discriminator and MLM embeddings should receive gradients from both the discriminator and MLM pretraining of the generator.

The authors introduced RMDA (Regularized Modernized Dual Averaging) which uses a weighted average of past gradients to calculate a tentative update and then applies a proximal operation related to the regularizer. The models parameters are then adjusted in the direction of this tentative update with a specific factor. The authors proved that RMDA theoretically identifies the NN structure in a finite number of iterations under certain conditions. Strengths and Weaknesses Using momentum and regularizers to enforce structure in optimization particularly NN training is common. RMDA extends the dual averaging algorithm with momentum. Weaknesses  The claims about variance reduction are unclear and its uncertain where such variance reduction is achieved in the paper. While RMDAs computational cost is similar to SGD maintaining momentum and dual averaging increases complexity.  The authors claim RMDA guarantees structure identification but this is an exaggeration since theres no convergence proof for RDMA. Theorem 2 assumes convergence and then shows that the converged parameter belongs to the active manifold.  The statement that RMDA \"identifies the optimum structure\" is difficult to prove since theres no way to definitively determine if the structure found is the best possible.

These conditions allow a large enough random subset of the penultimate layer activations to accurately predict the entire activation of the last layer. Moreover pruning the network to these subsets reduces the training error (though still lagging behind that of the full network). Notably the test error of these pruned networks decreases as the subset size increases similar to the test error reduction observed with wider regular networks.

Voice conversion is achieved by replacing the speaker embedding. The model comprises four loss functions for speech reconstruction embedding reconstruction speaker classification and adversarial speaker classification. Strengths and Weaknesses:  The combination of loss functions is not novel and the paper lacks justification for its use.  The experimental results in Table 1 are inconclusive due to varying model architectures and training losses.  The theoretical foundations (Section 3) are weak:  The assumption that linguistic content and speaker information can be strictly separated is flawed as speakers vary in sentence construction and pronunciation.  The claim that the content and speaker embeddings uniquely determine speech is false as individuals cannot produce identical speech utterances.  The information processing inequality assumption (I(Cx Sx) \u2265 I(Cx x)) is overly strong and likely incorrect. Weaknesses:  Disentanglement is not guaranteed despite using a speaker classifier and gradient reversal layer.  Reconstructing hidden vectors can lead to overfitting if the corresponding loss weight is too high.

Disentanglement Approach: To ensure clear separation the latent speech representation is divided into two components: speaker embedding and content embedding. Two classifiers a common speaker classifier and an adversarial speaker classifier are employed to enforce this distinction. Loss Functions: A novel \"codereconstruction loss\" is proposed to prevent content embedding from carrying speaker information. Strengths:  Simplified model architecture using a single encoder for both timber and content extraction.  Flexible partitioning of embeddings allows adjustment of their proportions.  Enhanced disentanglement with both common and adversarial speaker classifiers.  Vector norm eliminates speaker information from speaker embedding.  Codereconstruction loss ensures content embedding remains timberfree. Weaknesses:  Limited novelty as the proposed method essentially combines existing content and speaker encoders.  Potential technical errors such as the minimization of the total loss potentially increasing the adversarial speaker classification loss.  Unclear derivation of Zhat (and X) in the codereconstruction loss equation.  Ambiguity in referring to \"estimated content embedding\" in the reconstruction loss equation.

Strengths and Weaknesses Paraphrase: Strengths:  The backdoor attack method targets PTMs a significant security concern.  The attacks were tested on both text (NLP) and images (CV) tasks. Weaknesses:  The proposed attack assumes a binary classification task where the model predicts a predefined target class for triggered inputs. However it may be challenging to apply this approach to multiclass classification tasks with a moderate number of classes. Additionally the high dimensionality of PTM outputs would require a large number of predefined values.  The evaluation was conducted on simplified datasets rather than original downstream datasets and it remains unclear how the attack would perform on realworld datasets.  The paper does not provide clear guidance on selecting predefined values that lead to the prediction of specific target classes. The attacker may need access to either the blackbox or whitebox version of the finetuned model to determine the corresponding target label for each trigger which may not be feasible in practical threat models.  The proposed attack may not be effective against models that use batch normalization a common technique in modern neural networks.

Instead of enhancing the training environment with additional data to increase the models resilience the model is adjusted at test time to ignore specific distractions encountered in the environment. Experiments in simulations demonstrate the advantages of this approach particularly when the agent has no access to reward information at test time.

The approach focuses on using an inference model to learn the latent structure of the input rather than relying on data augmentation. This approach surpasses traditional indistribution generalization techniques and can handle cases where the target domain is unknown. Prior knowledge and lack of reward function in the test distribution present significant hurdles. In robotics such learning is crucial. Statement of Purpose: The authors propose to reformulate the outofdistribution generalization problem as an unsupervised policy adaptation between two Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with similar latent dynamics and reward structure but different observations. They aim to exploit probabilistic inference to achieve invariance by leveraging latent structure. Problem Formulation: Given two distinct MDPs Atrain and Atest the agent has access to ground truth information in Atrain but not in Atest. The key challenge is where the shift between Atrain and Atest occurs due to differences in observation spaces. Invariance Through Inference and Algorithm: The goal is to learn an encoder that maps semantically similar states from both MDPs to latent vectors. This is achieved without access to rewards in Atest and without paired trainingtest trajectories. The approach employs two objectives: 1. Distribution matching to align the latent distributions induced by both MDPs. 2. A GANstyle loss to prevent the latent code from relying on distracting information that distinguishes Atrain and Atest. The adaptation objective involves maximizing the mutual information between the prototypical representation from training and the adapted representations of new observations. Experiments: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using the Deepmind Control Suite (DMC) for training and the Distracting Control Suite (DistractingCS) for testing. Results show that baselines augmented with the proposed Invariance Through Inference (ITI) exhibit significantly reduced performance degradation as distraction intensity increases. ITI outperforms Policy Adaptation during Deployment (PAD) on DMC with fixed distraction intensity. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths:  Novel approach leveraging latent representations to model invariance.  No reliance on target distribution rewards.  Strong results on DMC with varying distraction dimensions.  Ablation study demonstrating the impact of the adversarial objective. Weaknesses:  Limited evaluation domain (robotics control).

The LPSC kernel is distributed within logpolar spaces allowing the receptive field to expand exponentially with increasing radius without requiring a significant increase in learning parameters. To implement LPSC the authors utilize logpolar space pooling to precompute an expanded feature map. The LPSC operation is then applied similarly to standard convolutional filters. The proposed LPSC is integrated into popular CNN backbones such as ResNet VGGNet and MobileNet. Experiments show that the modified networks outperform the original structures on several image recognition and segmentation datasets. Strengths:  The concept of LPSC is intriguing and offers a fresh approach to convolutional operations.  LPSC enables exponential expansion of the local receptive field without significantly increasing parameters which could be beneficial for dense prediction tasks like image segmentation.  The performance of LPSCbased networks surpasses that of the original versions across various architectures and datasets.  The concept is straightforward and the paper is generally easy to follow. Weaknesses:  The effectiveness of expanding the local receptive field may be underrepresented. The experiments use lightweight networks (e.g. ResNet1820 MobileNet) where the original receptive fields are not sufficiently dense. Its unclear if LPSC will be as effective in more complex models with larger receptive fields (e.g. ResNet101).  The authors do not discuss related works on expanding receptive fields such as Dense ASPP.  Computational efficiency is a potential concern. Precomputing the spatial mask and the exponential growth of the outer rings in the logpolar kernel can lead to increased time complexity.  The assumption that features near the center of the kernel are more important than those farther away is not fully explained or justified.  The performance improvements on some datasets are modest. The absence of results using more advanced models like ResNet101 or Xception65 limits the generalizability of the findings.

The radius is divided logarithmically to prioritize central content.  The new convolution operator is versatile and compatible with existing frameworks.  Empirical results show that it outperforms standard convolution with comparable parameters. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths:  The concept is logical and wellsupported by empirical results. Weaknesses:  1. Metaparameter Issues:  The paper claims to use consistent metaparameters for fair comparison but this is questionable.  Metaparameters can significantly impact performance so using identical values limits the informative nature of the comparisons.  The authors should demonstrate equal sensitivity to metaparameters among all methods.  2. Fair Parameter Comparisons:  Comparing models with equal parameters may not be fair as the proposed method resembles separable convolution with fixed depthwise convolution weights.  This effectively increases the models capacity compared to standard 2D convolution.  The authors should analyze the impact of the fixed logpolar space pooling layers on performance.  3. Generalizability to Deeper Models:  The paper only evaluates shallow models (ResNet20) where deep models may reduce the methods benefits or even harm performance.  The authors should consider the methods implications for more complex architectures like transformers and active convolution.  4.

Theorem 1 applies only when all individual classifiers are continuous before ensemble while Theorem 2 shows the continuity of the classifier after ensemble.  Its not clear whether EBS ensures the continuity of all individual classifiers before ensemble.  The paper could benefit from comparing the method with Average Certified Radius (ACR).

Maximum Principle: Neural networks with continuous monotonic activation and widths limited by the input layer achieve their maximum (and minimum) values at the boundary of compact domains. This explains why universal approximation with these functions on arbitrary compact sets is impossible. 2. Disjoint Domains: The authors claim a result in Theorem 2 that applies to \"finite collections of disjoint n0dimensional compact sets.\" However most of their discussion focuses on only two sets. The generalization to multiple disjoint sets is not clearly justified or supported by experiments. 3. Harmonic Activations: The authors demonstrate universal approximation on finite and discrete domains using the composition of cosine functions. This result is not directly relevant to the main topic of the paper as it hinges on the discreteness and finiteness of the domain not the width of the input layer.

The paper first demonstrates the existence of subsets that preclude universal approximation guarantees. Subsequently it provides sufficient conditions for specific compact subsets to enable universal approximation or exact interpolation guarantees particularly for applications in clustering and classification. The functions considered are piecewise constant over disjoint compact sets with general assumptions on activation functions that encompass most commonly used functions.

These subsets are relevant for clustering and classification applications. It provides conditions for exact interpolation by constantdepth ReLU networks (for two compact sets) or depth dependent on input size (for more than two sets). Additionally it demonstrates that any finite sample set can be exactly interpolated by a narrow and constantdepth network with cosine activation.

The paper does not justify why 8x8 binarized images are superior to 4x4 integer images used in [3]. 3. Lack of Comparison with Other Embedding Methods: Since the paper claims to have an effective embedding method comparisons with alternative methods (e.g. phasebased embedding [3] [4] statevector embedding [2]) are crucial. 4. Circuit Depth Sensitivity to Noise: The proposed embedding circuit appears complex (deep) making it potentially vulnerable to noise in NISQ devices. Real quantum device experiments (e.g. on IBMQ machines) could validate the results. 5. Limited Dataset and Hyperparameter Analysis: The study is based solely on the MNIST dataset without considering ablation studies on hyperparameters. Comparisons with previous QNN work are also absent. 6. Overstated Novelty Claim: The assertion that this work is the first to classify realistic images is exaggerated as previous studies [2] [3] [5] have achieved similar classification tasks on the MNIST dataset with [3] even demonstrating performance on real quantum machines. 7. Subpar Empirical Results: The experimental results suggest that classical neural networks consistently outperform the quantum models. 8. Justification of Circuit Choice: The paper should provide more justification for using CRAML and CRADL circuits.

Inconsistencies in reference formatting.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: The study presents a new regularization method that enforces geometric constraints on the latent space of an autoencoder. This method defines a hierarchy of geometrypreserving mappings emphasizing scaled isometries (maps that preserve angles and distances up to a scaling factor). The autoencoder training involves learning the scale factor alongside the manifold and latent space representation. A novel coordinateinvariant regularization term measures the proximity of the decoder to being a scaled isometry. A subsequent flattening procedure enhances the geometric properties of the latent space. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods in various application scenarios. Strengths and Weaknesses: The paper is wellstructured and offers a compelling solution to the challenging problem of incorporating geometry into latent space. The proposed regularization method is wellreasoned and theoretically sound. The coordinateinvariant functional is original and effective. The experiments are thorough and highlight the methods efficacy. However there are some areas for clarification:  Authors claim that a less stringent regularization on isometry is preferable but further evidence to support this is lacking.  The role of the stabilizing latent space flattening is unclear and should be elaborated.  While the methods superiority over FMVAE is acknowledged a more detailed explanation of the coordinateinvariant strategys significance is needed.

While current methods like SimCLR overlook geometric preservation this paper demonstrates the superiority of angle and relative distancepreserving mappings over angle and absolute distancepreserving mappings. The proposed representational learning technique combines reconstruction loss with isometric regularization achieving embeddings with isometric properties without compromising reconstruction quality. The paper compares its approach to VAE (Kingma  Welling 2014) and FMVAE (Chen et al. 2020). Strengths and Weaknesses: Pros:  Investigates geometrypreserving regularization in representational learning an important area with potential impact. Cons:  The paper employs a separate invertible mapping that does not affect reconstruction accuracy which could be addressed within the original decoder.  The assumption of H(x) as the identity simplifies the regularization but limits its domainspecific applicability.  Visualizations in Figure 1 do not clearly demonstrate the benefits of isometric regularization.  The paper lacks ablation studies on mixup regularization to isolate its contributions.

Strengths and Weaknesses Major Points  The study has a potentially significant impact by showing that polynomialsized discriminators may be insufficient for achieving distributional learning.  It prompts a reconsideration of whether GANs are more appropriate for feature learning than distributional learning.  The use of Wasserstein distance as an objective function may need to be reevaluated given the lack of correlation with GANs empirical performance.  Assumptions such as polynomialsized neural network discriminators and diverse target distributions appear reasonable.  The application of pseudorandom generator theory to GAN analysis is novel.  Numerical experiments provide support for the theoretical findings. Minor Points  Typos in the paper:  Definition 2: Replace \\mathbb Ex\\sim q(f(y)) with \\mathbbEx\\sim q (f(x)).  Eq (1): Replace \\mathcal Dd(m) with \\mathcal D\\astd(m).  Incomplete inequality in the proof sketch of Theorem 3.2: The inequality comparing \\mathbbE[\\mathcalM\\tau(G(Um))] and \\mathbbE[\\mathcalM\\tau(Ud)] is incomplete.", "Paraphrase: Summary: The study demonstrates that if Goldreichs pseudorandom generator (PRG) can deceive Boolean circuits of limited size it is possible to create a miniature rectified linear unit (ReLU) network that generates a distribution that is nearly identical to the target distribution (with respect to Wasserstein1 distance) but cannot be distinguished from the target by any ReLU network of reasonable size. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths:  The work reduces the question of \"bad solutions to the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) objective\" to the presence of local pseudorandom generators. This is an intriguing and unique idea.  The research shows that minmax optimality may not imply that the GAN learns the target distribution at least in certain artificial circumstances. Weaknesses:  The work relies heavily on theory.  The results significance is questionable because it is widely recognized and intuitive that deceiving a limited class of discriminators does not necessarily entail precisely matching the target distribution. Suggestions for Improvement:  Define \\gammam in Theorem 1.1 to enhance clarity.  Simplify Definition 5 for readers unfamiliar with cryptography by explaining terms like \"uniformly random kuniform hypergraph\" \"kary predicate\" and \"circuits in Ppoly.\"  Specify the failure probability in Lemma 2.4 (i.e. the result holds with probability at least 1\\delta).  Consolidate the numerous dispersed Lemmas to make the paper more coherent and reduce readers cognitive burden. For instance Lemma 2.1 is only applicable to Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 2.3 is selfevident and never used. Consider omitting these Lemmas from the main body of the paper.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: Even with (population) minimax optimality for a GAN the generator may not have learned to mimic the distribution under the Wasserstein distance. Specifically simple generators (randomized ReLU nets) with constant depth polynomial size and Lipschitzness properties can produce discrete distributions from simple seeds (e.g. uniform on a cube) that are distant (in Wasserstein distance) from any diverse distribution and indistinguishable from a diverse target distribution by polynomial discriminators. This proof relies on the assumption of the existence of local pseudorandom generators. Strengths and Weaknesses:  The results are original and significant establishing a link between GANs and local pseudorandom generators.  The authors claim that minimax optimality does not imply distribution learning which is imprecise because distribution learning depends on the chosen success measure.  The focus on Wasserstein distance is reasonable but somewhat arbitrary changing to another integral probability metric (IPM) could invalidate the result.  The success of GANs in applications like image generation may be partly due to their nonoptimization of traditional distancedivergence measures.  The papers presentation could be improved with clearer notation and additional background on pseudorandom generators for nonexperts. Clarifications and Details:  Random networks are used as generators allowing for discrete seed distributions but continuous output distributions.  The reductions in the paper may not hold for deterministic (e.g. ReLU) networks which should be explicitly stated.  The weak experimental section could be strengthened by using a continuous target distribution more typical in real applications. Minor Corrections:  Define \\gammam in Theorem 1.  Specify the parameter(s) referred to when mentioning \"polynomial discriminator\" and \"polynomial generator.\"  Define the negl function in the main text since it is used in the main theorem statements.  In Theorem 3.1 clarify that the generators parameters and Wasserstein factor WF depend on \\epsilon(m).  In equation (1) verify if Dd(m) should be f(Dd(m)).", "Paraphrase: Summary: This study examines generative adversarial networks (GANs) using a ReLUbased generator and discriminator optimizing the Wasserstein1 metric. It demonstrates the existence of a \"bad\" generator that can fool all discriminators under the estimated Wasserstein1 metric while significantly deviating from the true data distribution under the real Wasserstein1 metric. The proof employs two assumptions: one regarding the diversity of the target data distribution and another commonly used in cryptography. The findings consider the computational complexity of the model and potentially provide insights into the learnability of GANs. Strengths and Weaknesses: The paper is compelling but there are some concerns regarding its presentation and significance: 1. The assumption about data distribution diversity is insufficiently explained particularly in the main theorem making it unclear to readers. 2. The magnitude of the error term in Theorem 3.1 is unclear. Is it practical Does the result offer guidance for training GANs given that the Wasserstein1 metric estimation is monitored during training 3. Despite the papers claim that \"minimax optimality doesnt imply distribution learning for GANs\" it does not explore the likelihood of encountering this situation in practice which limits the papers significance. 4. There is a disconnect between the theoretical findings and the experiments. By training only four types of discriminators the authors may have omitted potential discriminator variations. A more comprehensive experiment that includes an example where the generator successfully deceives all discriminators would be beneficial.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: The paper demonstrates that a smallsized discriminator network (polynomial size) cannot effectively distinguish between the original data distribution and the distribution generated by a constant depth generator.

A novel ensembling technique that combines intermediate models produced by both clients over iterations asymptotically converges to the centralized model.

Strengths and Weaknesses: Novelty:  The paper introduces a novel idea of using ensembling intermediate models in federated learning. Significance:  The study aims to translate the theoretical insights into a modelagnostic federated learning framework with robust asymptotic guarantees. However there are concerns about the practical significance due to the significant gap between the theoretical setup and realworld settings: 1. Extension to MultiAgent Setting: The results are limited to a twoclient scenario and do not address multiagent settings which would require modifications to the averaging scheme. 2. Assumption of Equal Data: The assumption of equal data across clients is unrealistic in practice and its impact on the averaging scheme is not explored. 3. Flaw in Alternating Knowledge Distillation (AKD): The theoretical results are based on a flaw in the AKD setup where one client does not see its true training output. This flaw may not exist in other knowledge distillation methods. 4. Potential Unnecessity of AvgKD: If the flaw in AKD is corrected the AvgKD mechanism may become redundant. 5. Reliance on Regression Model: The results are tied to a specific regression formulation and may not be applicable to classification settings or other statistical models. 6. Communication Cost: The knowledge distillation process requires clients to share models leading to a higher communication cost compared to standard federated learning. Soundness:  The theoretical results appear correct but concerns exist about their applicability in realworld settings due to the limitations mentioned above. Clarity:  The paper is wellorganized and easy to follow but some grammatical errors are present.

Theoretically the study shows that the original approach can fail but the ensemble approach is optimal under certain conditions. Empirically the findings are confirmed. The analysis suggests broader applicability as similar behavior is observed when using neural networks instead of kernel regression.

Strengths:  The paper is wellstructured and straightforward to understand.  The experiments are effectively designed to back the assertions. Weaknesses:  In Section 7.3 the provided results for BERT are questionable. Pretraining could be a confounding factor that is not being accounted for. For instance the word frequency data is already embedded in the BERT models parameters along with other attributes that apply to scrambled text as well. Therefore it is unsurprising that BERT would outperform when finetuned on scrambled data (with word frequency maintained). LSTMs superior resilience stems from its small model size enabling it to relearn all weights.

Predictor NN: Optimizes its performance based on the loss function defined by the losslearning NN. Two key techniques enhance the effectiveness of this approach:  Loss exploration: Adds noise to the nondifferentiable loss to promote exploration and prevent overfitting.  Cotraining: Trains the two neural networks concurrently ensuring that the losslearning NN guides the predictor NNs optimization. Experiments involving time series prediction tasks support the proposed method. Strengths  Conversion of nondifferentiable loss functions to differentiable versions which expands the range of regression tasks that can be optimized.

It consists of two learning components: one for forecasting the next time step and another for learning the loss function. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enhances performance slightly over MAE. Strengths and Weaknesses: From my perspective this paper has several significant issues: 1. Questionable Outer Learning Objective: Unlike most metalearning approaches this papers outer learning goal is simply to reduce the difference from the existing MAE loss function. This approach seems illogical because the purpose of loss learning is to surpass existing loss functions like MAE but the proposed method aims to minimize the deviation from MAE. The authors do not provide a convincing justification for this choice. Additionally the introduction of noise during learning appears adhoc without a clear explanation of its rationale. 2. Lack of Novelty: The paper claims that its method of cotraining the predictor and loss is innovative. However it is similar to the commonly used approach of onestep lookahead or online firstorder approximation which is wellestablished in metalearning and gradientbased hyperparameter optimization. The authors should properly cite these existing approaches and clarify their methods distinct features. 3. Insufficient Baselines and Justifications: The paper only compares its method to MAE and does not consider other standard loss functions such as MSE or MSLE.

They superimposed labels on each image and recorded CLIPs response. The authors analyze CLIPs errors on these images and argue that since the errors cannot be predicted by the semantic or spelling similarity between the superimposed word and the depicted object (which is the case in human psychology experiments) CLIP does not process images in the same way as humans. However the authors motivation is unclear as CLIPs objective is to match image captions. Labeling the text as \"incorrect\" is misleading since CLIP may justifiably assign high scores to both the depicted object and the superimposed word. The authors main argument that CLIP behaves differently from humans is based on the observation that labelswitched misclassifications (where CLIP predicts the written word rather than the depicted object) do not depend on semantic or spelling distance. However this argument is problematic because it does not account for the inherent ambiguity of the setup.

The belief approximation is learned through variational inference and an actorcritic reinforcement learning algorithm is designed based on this representation. Strengths and Weaknesses:  The accurate estimation of beliefs is crucial but challenging in continuousstate POMDPs. This paper proposes a normalizing flowbased belief approximation to address this difficulty.  The proposed method of learning the belief approximation maximizes an Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO).  An actor and a critic are learned in conjunction with the normalizing flow belief approximation.  Experiments demonstrate that the normalizing flowbased belief achieves higher ELBO than a baseline Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM) on the MNIST sequence dataset. Additionally the actorcritic algorithm exhibits strong performance on several problems from the DeepMind Control Suite.  The paper is generally straightforward to comprehend. However some key aspects of the idea need clarification to fully understand its correctness. Clarification Requests:  In Equation (7) and Theorem 1 the expectations should be taken with respect to q(s1T  \u03c4T oT). It would be helpful to explicitly state how q(s1T  \u03c4T oT) factorizes.  Please explain the rationale behind the architecture illustrated in Figure 3.  How are the observations and actions encoded into q\u03c8(st  taut ot)  Where do the transition dynamics p\u03c8(st  st1 at1) and the observation model p\u03c8(ot  st) appear in the belief model If they are utilized for encoding actions and observations they are not designed to approximate the true dynamics and observation model. Using them as such in Equations (12) and (13) seems questionable.  Equation (9) differs from Equation (7) because Equation (7) employs a Markov transition model p(st  st1 at1) while Equation (9) utilizes a nonMarkov transition model p(st  taut).  In the reinforcement learning algorithm the actor and critic are both functions of the state not the belief. How is an action calculated for a belief in this case  While there is a discussion of the learning objectives for the actor and critic a complete description of the reinforcement learning algorithm is lacking. For instance how is training experience gathered Which experiences are stored in the experience buffer (Algorithm 1) How frequently are the belief model actor and critic updated Questions and Concerns Regarding Experiments:  For the digit writing task what constitutes the state  Details about the neural networks employed are missing.  RSSM originates from the PlaNet paper not the Okada et al. 2020 paper.  The proposed belief model and RSSM are only compared on the digit writing task. Can they be assessed on problems from the DeepMind Control Suite  Results are only provided for six out of 20 problems from the DeepMind Control Suite. For some issues the Dreamers findings still fall short of those provided in the original Dreamer paper. This discrepancy may be due to the algorithms only being run for 500k steps while the Dreamer papers results are obtained after 5 million steps. To see if the new algorithm can eventually match Dreamers reported performance it would be beneficial to run it for a longer period.

Given a limited labeled dataset from a target domain and extensive unlabeled data from multiple source domains the question is how to select examples from the source domains for labeling to enhance performance on the target domain.

Notably the proposed method called DALE selects examples from the source domain that are similar to misidentified target domain examples and outperforms standard \"discriminative active learning\" in most experiments. The analysis indicates that selecting examples from diverse domains is beneficial and DALE helps prevent the selection of problematic examples.

Strengths:  The issue of data augmentation for graph classification is intriguing and merits attention.  The paper is clear and easy to understand.  The authors theoretically proved that ifMixup is intrusionfree. Weaknesses:  The improvements shown in the tables are minor.  ifMixup is essentially a direct application of Mixup to graphs which reduces its technical originality.

This is achieved by blending two input graph pairs (incorporating dummy nodes) as per standard mixup principles. Strengths:  The proposed mixup strategy is straightforward.  The motivation for mitigating manifold intrusion is evident.  The discussion of oversmoothing in Section 4.2.3 and Figure 5 is wellexplored demonstrating the effectiveness of the mixup method in addressing this problem.  Evaluation results include performance analysis on eight graph classification datasets. Weaknesses:  The proof of invertibility in Section 3.3 assumes binary edge weights (0 or 1).  It is unclear whether the method can handle graphs with realvalued edge weights and still maintain invertibility.  The assumption that lambda is not 0.5 in the invertibility proof may not align with standard mixup practices.  The relationship between invertibility and manifold intrusionfree behavior is unclear. It is not evident how recovering interpolated graphs ensures compatibility with other training samples.  The experiments exclusively employ 5 and 8layer GNNs exploring shallower structures is recommended.  Section 4.3.1 lacks clear connections to the proposed method.  The study fails to evaluate the methods effectiveness on node classification tasks where similar mixup techniques have been used successfully.  A comparison with existing graph mixup methods (e.g. GraphMix [1]) is missing.", "Paraphrased Summary: This paper introduces a technique for mixing samples represented as graphs. The process involves: 1. Matching node indices across graphs of different sizes by padding the smaller graph with dummy nodes. 2. Intermixing the features and edge connections associated with nodes having the same index from the original graphs. The paper claims that this approach prevents the \"manifold intrusion\" problem where mixed graphs may overlap with other graphs in the dataset. Strengths and Weaknesses:  Strength:  Extends the concept of Mixup to graph data addressing an important research gap.  Clear writing in most sections.  Weaknesses:  The claim about avoiding manifold intrusion remains unsubstantiated as the method may not prevent the mixed graph from coinciding with existing or future graphs.  Mathematical notation in Section 3.3 could be simplified for clarity.  Node features cannot be fully recovered from the mixed graph and edge weights are lost if present.  Results are marginally better than alternative mixing techniques that operate in the representation space.", "Paraphrase: This paper introduces a straightforward technique for mixing graphs in the input space. Vertices are arranged in any order and dummy vertices are added to equalize the number of vertices in the graphs to be mixed. Mixing is then applied to both vertices and edges. This method significantly improves performance surpassing current stateoftheart results on various benchmark datasets. It includes a theoretical guarantee that the mixed graphs avoid a specific issue called \"intrusions.\" The algorithm referred to as \"IntrusionFree Mixup\" (ifMixup) interpolates edges and nodes and assigns interpolated values to labels based on the edges. Source graphs can be recovered from the mixed graphs. Instead of assigning class labels to nodes the task is to group each graph under a single class. Dummy nodes which lack edges are added to ensure that all graphs have the same size. The method involves constructing \"soft\" edges by mixing edges between two graphs allowing the network to process these soft edges. The graph mixing operation is proven to be invertible. ifMixup benefits from increased model depth and mixing rates contrary to a baseline model that exhibits overfitting. Strengths and Weaknesses: The paper introduces a simple and logical algorithm for graph mixup which achieves impressive results on diverse datasets. The algorithm supports the use of larger models and mixing rates. It suggests further research avenues such as mixing in random layers. The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field.

The authors claim to employ model ensembling but the algorithm suggests they are primarily augmenting the optimizer (SGD) with a momentum term.

For example Theorem 1 concludes that SEAT \"hardly be approximate to the average prediction of history networks.\" The meaning of \"hardly be approximate\" is unclear. Limited Experimental Evaluation: The experimental evaluation lacks an adaptive attack which could exploit the methods potentially smooth loss landscape.

The proposed approach can handle a broad range of image transformations potentially leading to major advancements in this field.

Optimization is also performed for each sample individually. There is a noticeable trend where UNet and VQVAE models perform poorly compared to their counterparts (Tables 1 and 2).

This approach is more stringent than \"edgelevel privacy\" because it accounts for the impact of a single node on the training process which may involve connections to numerous other nodes. In contrast edgelevel privacy only considers the impact of a single edge. Strengths and Weaknesses While the specified privacy parameter of 30 seems high other industrial applications have utilized similar parameters. The study raises the question of whether edgelevel privacy with lower parameters offers greater privacy than nodelevel privacy with such a high parameter. For edgelevel privacy it has been demonstrated that nodelevel privacy can be ensured by adjusting privacy parameters according to the number of edges connected to a node. However the converse may not always hold: nodelevel privacy of 30 may not equate to a significantly lower edge privacy guarantee. The privacy guarantee is not surprising because if each node is guaranteed a maximum of K neighbors its influence extends to K other nodes. To ensure edgelevel privacy constant noise would guarantee constant privacy parameters but adding or removing K edges would require proportional noise to maintain constant parameters. The analysis does not explicitly explain whether it refutes this intuition or provides a technical reason for its breakdown. The experiments involve gradient clipping which depends on the dataset and requires scaling factor finetuning. It is unclear whether this ensures privacy and an exhaustive hyperparameter search is employed. In Figure 1 DPMLP seems to perform better than DPGNN at moderate privacy parameters (e.g. 7). The reason for this and the point at which one method outperforms the other should be clarified. While the proposed approach may offer advantages over existing methods in some privacy scenarios it is unclear when these improvements occur (e.g. at specific epsilon values). Multiple hyperparameters require tuning raising concerns about whether the extra privacy budget allocated to these parameters outweighs edgelevel privacy. The novelty of the algorithm is also uncertain as it appears nodes could be preprocessed to have at most K edges and then processed using an edgelevel private algorithm to achieve the same nodelevel privacy guarantee.

It sets up a training environment where different cues have equal importance. The study shows that cues like color are learned more easily than cues like orientation or shape.

The core idea is for skill policies to follow generated trajectories based on relevant factors. For this the authors train a variational autoencoder (VAE) that provides both control variables (latent encoding) and a predictive model of the trajectory (decoder). The skill policy is trained to match the trajectories of the predictive model which is then used for MPC. Despite the potential complexity of the method experimental results do not justify it. The basic elements used in WEDIS (VAE on trajectories training skill policies on a resulting reward signal) are common in skill discovery techniques like OPAL and EDL. While the authors demonstrate improvements over purely unsupervised skill learning methods (DADS and SeCTAR) on downstream navigation tasks the primary concern is the introduction of supervision in WEDIS. The authors motivation for using an autoencoder setup when reference trajectories can be generated beforehand is unclear. Why not simply pretrain a policy with a reward to explicitly follow these trajectories based on salient factors (direction speed curvature) This should at least be included as a baseline in the paper. While the training setup in WEDIS could allow for more generality it requires the ability to generate reference trajectories which would enable training policies to follow them directly. Additionally the experiments lack a comparison to plain Soft ActorCritic (SAC).

The parameterization of the two networks can vary between SSL modules (e.g. identical for SimCLRSimSiam nonidentical for MoCoBYOL). During each iteration the online network from each client is uploaded to a server for averaging. The averaged online network is then distributed back to clients. Each client updates their online network as a weighted average of the global and local online networks to accommodate potential data heterogeneity and continues updating the SSL module via gradient updates.

Through experiments they demonstrate that DISSECT outperforms existing techniques in terms of \"importance\" \"realism\" \"distinctness\" and \"stability.\" Strengths  Innovative approach: DISSECT stands out as a unique approach to counterfactual explanation focusing on creating multiple explanations with varying degrees of concept influence. This could prove valuable in practice as it allows for visualization of changes in prediction as a concepts relevance increases.  Thorough evaluation: DISSECTs effectiveness is tested across three diverse datasets each chosen to highlight a specific aspect of the problem. The authors introduce metrics for each evaluation criterion allowing for comprehensive analysis. DISSECT consistently surpasses benchmark methods. Weaknesses  Novel evaluation metrics: Several of the evaluation metrics are proposed in this paper and further justification for their ability to accurately measure the desired properties would be beneficial. For example simulations with known \"ground truth\" could be used to validate the \"realism\" metric.

ZOAC employs a novel trajectory sampling technique that involves using different policies for a limited number of steps before switching. The paper demonstrates that adjusting the number of steps with each policy can reduce the variance of the zerothorder gradient estimator. Empirical evaluations suggest that ZOAC outperforms other zerothorder and firstorder baseline algorithms. Strengths and Weaknesses: While ZOACs perturbed trajectory sampling approach is innovative theres a concern about computing a valid value function from these mixedpolicy trajectories. Equation 14 uses a single critic to learn from return estimates across multiple perturbed policies. Its unclear which policys value this value function represents. For accurate advantage calculation and policy updates (Equations 1516) the advantage should be computed using the value function for each perturbed policy. However ZOAC seems to learn a single critic over all perturbed policies and derive the zerothorder gradient based on this critic. While this may be acceptable for Mujocolike domains where optimizing shortterm rewards suffices it could be problematic for domains where longterm rewards matter. The empirical evaluations lack ablation studies to demonstrate ZOACs strengths and robustness. Additionally the overall performance comparisons against stateoftheart actorcritic algorithms (e.g. SAC) are underwhelming. Including such comparisons would provide a more comprehensive assessment.

Strengths and Weaknesses The concept of adding an auxiliary task that discriminates between labeled and unlabeled instances is intriguing. A similar discriminator was first introduced in active learning in this approach [1]. The VAAL algorithm [1] employs a similar discriminator to identify labeled and unlabeled examples and subsequently use them to measure example uncertainty for active selection. The proposed method is therefore closely related to a recent SSL paper [2] which also uses uncertainty to choose highquality pseudolabels. However there are some areas where improvement can be made: 1. The logic in section 3.2 is unclear. For instance in Eq. (3) the second equality is invalid and the term \\fracdddx should be included. Additionally it would be beneficial to modify the d notation (discriminator) because the derivative dx also employs the d notation.

Additional Comments The papers findings could be valuable to the NLP community but the authors should address these weaknesses for greater clarity and impact.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: This paper presents an attack method for targeting the explanations provided by Natural Language Processing (NLP) text classification models. The method is straightforward and involves ranking word importance in the input sample and then employing a technique called \"counterfitted GloVe\" to select candidate words for substitution that preserve confidence in the correct class prediction while altering the explanation. The authors have thoroughly tested their method to gauge its efficacy. Strengths and Weaknesses: The task of attacking NLP model explanations is a significant and appealing one. The proposed approach is a generic framework that can be applied to a wide range of NLP models. The method calculates word importance scores and subsequently explores substitutions for those words. The proposed approachs attribution robustness as described in Equations 4 and 6 appears promising. While this work is among the first to address the issue of attacking explanations in NLP the solution is fairly straightforward and does not introduce many novel concepts. In essence the attackers simply modify the objective function to meet their goals which means that current NLP attack techniques can still be used to target explanation mechanisms. This might trivialize the development of solutions for attacking text classification explanations.

It presents: Contributions:  For linear VAEs with Gaussian data with a degenerate covariance matrix and linear encoderdecoder it proves that VAEs accurately capture the intrinsic dimensionality of the data by examining the objective and gradient flow dynamics.  For nonlinear VAEs it presents a counterexample to the conjecture by Dai and Wipf (2019) demonstrating that the support of VAE generators can exceed that of the data distribution.  Numerical experiments support the theoretical findings. Strengths:  The combination of loss landscape and gradient flow analysis strengthens the claim made by Dai and Wipf (2019) for linear VAEs.  The sigmoid dataset example simplifies the observation that VAEs may overestimate intrinsic dimensionality. Weaknesses:  The organization of the paper could be improved as the explanation of the discussion structure is unclear.  The paper lacks practical advice for practitioners who use nonlinear VAEs despite the negative result suggesting that the VAE objective can lead to overfitting.

This defense analyzes the embedding of training data into a lowdimensional subspace. They observe that adversarial examples increase the dimensionality of this subspace distinguishing them from natural data. The proposed defense adds a penalty term that reduces variance along the first principal component. Experiments on Cifar10 100 and SVHN datasets show improvements in accuracy under attacks when this regularizer is combined with other defense methods. Strengths and Weaknesses  Strengths:  The exploration of the relationship between attack sensitivity and embedding subspace is innovative.  The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularizer.  Weaknesses:  The study lacks theoretical explanations or connections between embedding dimensionality and attack robustness.  The experiments indicate that a more homogeneous distribution of variances does not prevent adversarial attacks.  The effectiveness of the approach may vary across datasets and the lack of guidelines for weight tuning limits its practical applicability. Theorem 1 Analysis The proof of Theorem 1 is flawed as it assumes y is a constant when optimizing over Z which is incorrect since y is a function of z. Minor Issues  Language errors should be addressed.  The specific embedding space and its relevance to known robustness factors are unclear.

The authors devised a metric to evaluate feature alterations under attacks and discovered that eigenvectors associated with smaller eigenvalues are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Demonstrating that using offtheshelf image generators does not enhance downstream tasks. 2. Introducing a jointly trained framework consisting of an intheloop generator selfsupervision block refinement block and an EMstyle optimization technique that outperforms singletask and multitask baselines. 3.

Strengths:  The paper presents an initial experiment showing that conventional image generators are ineffective for data augmentation.  It includes extensive experiments demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over existing stateoftheart models.  Ablation studies partially justify the design choices made in the method. Weaknesses: Major Concerns:  The papers claim of being beneficial in \"low data regimes\" lacks convincing evidence. The experiments with limited datasets (25 or 50 images) are not truly representative of low data scenarios (e.g. 100 images).  In some cases baseline models show greater robustness to data scarcity than the proposed method raising questions about its effectiveness in this context.  The generative models role seems marginal as its removal only marginally diminishes performance.

Solution: Reparamaterize the model using a function that grows unboundedly as time approaches zero. Problem 3: The loss function has a wide range of scales leading to an imbalance in gradient contributions. Solution: Use a \"soft truncation\" trick that samples time points from different ranges focusing some batches on small time steps and others on large time steps.

This paper addresses this issue by introducing a modified parameterization for unbounded data scores and a practical technique (STtrick) to manage score value scale variations. It also proposes Reciprocal Variance Exploding Stochastic Differential Equations (RVESDE) for model sampling.

For instance in industry or indoor settings distinguishing between objects of the same type but with different colors sizes or shapes may be crucial. This paper enables the categorization of unknown objects based on attributes like white blue silver black brown bottle cup clamp circle cylinder box and rectangular. The researchers achieve zeroshot detection through a simple attribute prediction method. Attribute labels are assigned to training images and the method generalizes to unseen objects in test images. Strengths:  The problem addressed is practically significant. Object detectors and classifiers should not overfit to object color or size within the same class. For example if a neural network has only encountered black dogs during training it should still recognize white dogs during deployment.  Generalized zeroshot learning is less explored compared to traditional zeroshot learning. Weaknesses:  The novelty is limited. Attributebased zeroshot learning is an established approach.  The experimental results are disappointing with low recall ratios for several classes. Zeroshot detection methods should ideally detect unseen objects even with limited attribute presence in the training set.  The study only utilizes a single dataset and lacks comparisons to prior work. The authors should justify this lack of comparison.  The attribute list is restrictive and may not be scalable to broader applications. It may be challenging to label all attributes in all images for general use. Hierarchical labeling might be more beneficial.  The lack of reporting on mean average precision (mAP) a standard metric for object detection is a concern.

Previous studies have shown improvements in deep learning for various domains but tabular data problems often rely on traditional algorithms like XGBoost and Catboost.  SAINT incorporates a novel attention mechanism that operates both within samples (rows) and across features (columns).  It embeds continuous features unlike previous models that only embed categorical ones.  SAINT is evaluated on 30 diverse datasets and compared to 10 existing models outperforming them with an average rank of 2.7 (vs. 4.0 for Catboost).  Ablation studies highlight the impact of attention and embedding.  SAINT exhibits explainability through its application to MNIST.  The paper also proposes a contrastive learning technique for unsupervised data pretraining and finetuning which enhances performance on limited labeled data.

HN operates under the insight that optimal statistics for normalization (mean and standard deviation) can be derived from different pixel sets. Key Features:  Calculates the mean in the style of BN but uses the approach of exponential normalization (EN) to stabilize the variance.  Achieves comparable or slightly better performance than BN in typical batch sizes (e.g. 32 or 16).  Significantly outperforms BN in extremely small batch sizes (e.g. 4).

Robust to varying batch sizes and costfree for inference (in some configurations). Weaknesses:  Does not consistently outperform stateoftheart normalization methods on large datasets (e.g. ImageNet).

BATS can optimize a range of objectives (such as BLEU). It evaluates each node by scoring a greedy rollout using an autoregressive model reducing biases caused by other heuristics (e.g. beam search). Additionally it proposes a new objective Max Rank which aligns better with translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that BATS outperforms beam search and can enhance NMT modeling. Strengths:  Innovative and welldefined motivation  Strong empirical results demonstrating the algorithms effectiveness  Eyeopening insights into beam searchs limitations  The decoding algorithm has the potential to advance text generation Weaknesses:  While BATS achieves high accuracy it introduces computational overhead due to multiple rollouts per node. The authors should analyze this efficiency aspect more thoroughly.  The experimental section could benefit from improved presentation and organization. Questions:  In the equation for \"r\" on page 6 the term \"lower\" seems incorrect and should be replaced with \"larger\" for consistency with the definition of \"r.\"  The paper claims generalization across autoregressive and nonautoregressive models but the results for nonautoregressive models are not explicitly mentioned.

This algorithm incorporates an autoregressive model which acts as a value network to predict the next steps in the generation process for each node in the tree. To address limitations in previous approaches that relied on summing tokenlevel log probabilities the paper proposes a novel metric termed \"max rank.\" The algorithms performance is evaluated using machine translation data sets and it consistently outperforms the traditional beam search approach. Strengths and Weaknesses:  The paper tackles a critical aspect of text generation: developing an efficient decoding algorithm for language models.  The introduction of an autoregressive model as the value network and the proposal of a new metric for nonautoregressive decoding are notable contributions.  The method achieves better results than beam search as demonstrated in the experiments. Concerns:  The writing quality of the paper could be significantly improved. The current version is difficult to follow and essential technical details are missing.  For instance information about the autoregressive model used (architecture training details datasets and latency during scoring) is not provided.  Some technical terms (e.g. \"d()\" \"other actions\" etc.) are undefined.  To enhance clarity a table defining problem definitions and notations at the beginning of Section 3 is recommended.  The inclusion of pseudocode for the algorithm would simplify its understanding.  In the experiments the baseline ARNAR models exact model and decoding method are not specified.  The paper claims that NAR models typically underperform compared to AR models but Table 2 suggests the opposite. The authors need to explain this discrepancy.  It is unclear whether knowledge distillation is employed to train the NAR model.  In NAR models the method for calculating token probabilities (whether it follows the equation in Section 4.1) should be clarified.  The proposed method appears to be timeconsuming due to the use of an AR model. A comparison of decoding speeds with baseline methods is not provided.  Several typos persist (e.g. \"a iterative manner\" should be \"an iterative manner\"). Additional Concerns after Rebuttal:  Inconsistent usage of terminology and claims make the paper difficult to understand.  The authors claim that \"ARNAR\" in Table 2 refers to different objectives (NC and MR) but the abstract suggests that the backbone models of ARNAR are the same with different objectives leading to different models.  The comparison with beam search may not be fair. Beam search with beam sizes of 5 or 6 is commonly used in practice which is significantly faster than BATS (2030 times faster according to Table 6) while achieving similar performance gains.  The authors claim that BATS addresses the issue of translation quality degradation with increasing beam size but Table 6 shows that BATS also suffers from this problem.

AFL allows participating clients to independently determine their local steps communication intervals step sizes and batch sizes removing the need for uniform sampling. The authors present a theoretical convergence rate for AFL and demonstrate its equivalence to FedAvg under specific assumptions. Empirical evaluations support the effectiveness of AFL. Strengths and Weaknesses: While the overall concept of AFL is intriguing and the theoretical results appear sound several concerns arise:  Variable Convergence Rate: AFLs convergence rate can be negatively impacted under nonuniform worker information arrival. Workers with extensive delays or local steps may hinder training progress as Algorithm 2 and 3 do not prevent the incorporation of such delayed gradients.  Unrealistic Assumptions: AFLs assumption of uniform distributed worker information arrival and bounded maximum delay and local steps may not hold in practical federated learning scenarios.  Vulnerability to Attacks: AFLs decentralized nature makes it more susceptible to attacks. Adversarial clients can exploit the freedom to join training at any time increasing the likelihood of malicious updates being included in the aggregation. FedAvgs uniform sampling mechanism reduces this risk.

The study analyzes the convergence properties of the proposed asynchronous schemes in scenarios with both uncertain worker participation and specific assumptions about the distribution of active workers or limited delays. Additionally the paper empirically demonstrates the competitive performance of the asynchronous scheme compared to synchronous baselines. Strengths:  Provides theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed asynchronous algorithms in federated environments.  Establishes a lower bound for convergence without assumptions about worker communication patterns serving as a reference point for future improvements. Weaknesses:  The proposed algorithms closely resemble those presented in a previously published paper (link provided). While the current submission offers improved analysis in certain aspects (e.g. without bounded gradients) the core algorithms and motivations overlap significantly. Clarification on any key differences would be beneficial.  The purpose and distinction between the two variations designed for crossdevice and crosssilo settings are unclear. The paper assumes a powerful server in both cases but does not provide references for this assumption.  The uniform arrival assumption for crossdevice FL and the bounded delay assumption for crosssilo FL both aim to control model update staleness. However the mapping between these assumptions and the compatibility with each setting is not explicitly stated.  The potential advantage of asynchronous training to mitigate the impact of stragglers needs to be empirically validated through simulations of system heterogeneity.  The strong assumptions of bounded delays or uniform arrivals may not be applicable in practical deployments where delays can be unbounded.  The lower bound established for FedAvg (Remark 1) raises questions as under suitable step sizes there should not be a constant error term.  Section 3(1) places emphasis on the generality of AFL but this aspect is not unique to AFL as previous federated optimization methods also support devicespecific local steps and hyperparameters.  The claim in Section 2 that synchronous servercentric algorithms are difficult to implement is not sufficiently justified.  The term \"general worker information arrival process\" introduced in the abstract lacks context and clarity.  The empirical evaluation lacks details on how stragglers are simulated such as the distribution of client starting points and any potential bias in sampling schemes.", "Summary This research introduces Anarchic Federated Learning (AFL) a general FL framework that allows clients to freely participate by choosing their individual update frequency and delay. Algorithms for crossdevice and crosssilo FL are proposed along with theoretical convergence bounds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Strengths and Weaknesses AFLs strength lies in its \"autonomous\" control where clients decide their FL participation. However the fundamental problem is similar to asynchronous FL with random client selection. The additional freedoms introduced such as varying local update steps and delays are ultimately masked by worstcase representations. Theorem 1 suggests that a single instance of a client with a large update step or delay can dominate the entire convergence process which is counterintuitive. This discourages its use especially when considering the possibility of such an occurrence throughout the FL process. Other concerns include:  Waiting for m local updates is restrictive leading to potential participation limitations and straggler issues.  The claim that only uniformly distributed delay results in sampling m clients without replacement is incorrect as the model still acts similarly with nonuniform distributions.  Theorem 3s improvement with uniformly distributed delay is unexplained given the assumption of worstcase delay in Theorem 3.  Theorem 2s dependence on \u03b1L scaling with \u03c42 is not addressed clearly in Corollary 1.  A typo in the abbreviation CSAFL should be corrected to AFLCS.", "Summary This paper studies a variant of federated averaging where workers can participate partially and updates can be asynchronous. It considers both stateful and stateless settings representing crosssilo and crossdevice federated learning respectively. The server uses gradients from m out of M workers in each global update where each worker may make local updates using a stale global iterate before contributing to the gradient calculation. This setting is called anarchic federated learning (AFL) when workers can take an arbitrary number of local steps and experience arbitrary delays. The authors provide a lower bound for convergence to a firstorder stationary point in the AFL setting. They also derive upper bounds for the convergence of their algorithms in the stateful and stateless settings when local updates and delays are bounded. Under certain assumptions on worker sampling and delay distribution a linear convergence speedup is possible with respect to the number of machines (m for the stateless setting and M for the stateful setting). Strengths and Weaknesses Convergence Results 1. Assumption 3 Relaxation: Assumption 3 could be relaxed to bound heterogeneity only at stationary points of the local functions as in [referred work](https:arxiv.orgpdf2006.04735.pdf). This assumption better captures worker heterogeneity. It should also be clarified what xks represents in assumptions 2 and 3 and assumption 3 needs an expectation because xks are random variables. 2. Theorem 1 Improvements: Theorem 1 should state that it holds for any AFL algorithm with general initialization and hyperparameters. The theorems current form is vague and potentially incorrect. A more precise lower bound is needed for any optimization algorithm in this setting (see references cited). 3. Theorem 1 Limitations: The lower bound proof ignores the effect of local stepsize and assumes an infinite number of local steps which does not align with the assumptions used in the algorithms. 4. Noniid FL Interpretation: The theorems claim that it holds for noniid FL is misleading as the lower bound already assumes heterogeneity. 5. Corollary 1 Improvement: The \\(\\sigmaG2\\) term in Corollary 1 should be removed based on concerns with the lower bound in Theorem 1. 6. Novelty of AFL: The theoretical result in Theorem 3 does not represent true AFL as it only considers uniform partial client participation. The result falls short of providing novel insights beyond known results for nonuniform local updates and asynchronous updates. Experiments 1. Emulation of Anarchic Behavior: It is unclear how anarchic machine behavior was emulated in Figure 1. 2. Communication Round Definition: The meaning of a communication round in the asynchronous and partial client sampling setting needs to be clarified. 3. Hidden Dependencies: The dependence on L and \\(\\sigmaL2\\) in the corollaries should be explicit to enable meaningful comparison with other convergence results. A table comparing convergence rates with noniid FL baselines would be valuable. Minor Comments 1. Linear Speedup Terminology: The term \"linear speedup\" is often misused in FL literature. It should be emphasized that this refers to convergence to a firstorder stationary point and that the speedup is conditional and valid only up to a certain number of machines. 2.

No evidence or explanation is given for the assertion that RNNs based on fixed points or restricted eigenspectrum do not exhibit chaotic dynamics.

The authors propose a probabilistic approach to this problem where F defines a probability distribution p(S) that represents the probability of coalition S forming. The task of defining \u03c6(F) is then framed as a \"decoupling problem.\" While the agents may be intricately correlated under p to assign individual importance values these interactions must be simplified or decoupled. The researchers aim to find a product distribution q that closely matches p under the KL divergence. They define q as a set of independent Bernoulli distributions where the probability of agent i participating is denoted xi. By using coordinate ascent the authors optimize the probabilities x1...xn. The importance score of player i is then defined as log(xi(1xi)) ignoring a temperature term T for clarity.

This has practical value. However the papers theoretical arguments lack rigor. The definition of stability and the proofs of stability results are unclear and imprecise. The paper would benefit from focusing solely on empirical results and their implications. Specific Concerns Regarding Theoretical Arguments  Definition 1: The use of the sum of derivatives as an indicator of exploding or vanishing gradients is questionable. It does not align with the standard definition of local stability in dynamical systems.  Proof of Theorem 1: The proof structure is unclear. It does not provide a clear argument for why the product of Jacobians up to time T implies exploding or vanishing dynamics.  Implication of Corollary 1: The conclusion that wellconditioned gradients can hinder model capacity is not supported by the provided argument.  Proof of Theorem 2: The proof relies on assumptions that are equivalent to the theorems claim making it circular.  Theorem 3: The result is not specific to gating mechanisms. It can also be applied to RNNs without gating if initialized with stable network weights. Minor Issue  RungeKutta Method: The RungeKutta method is not correctly defined.

Unclear terminology regarding causality: The paper implies causality in its title and abstract but does not explicitly provide causal explanations. The authors should clarify their terminology.  Lack of formal Nash equilibrium formulation: The optimization constraint in LINEX may not constitute a Nash equilibrium. A formal formulation is needed for proper interpretation and analysis.  Limited guidance on number of environments: The authors demonstrate LINEX in multiple environments but do not provide guidance on how to determine an optimal number. Positive Note: The paper demonstrates practical applications and shows promising results.", "Paraphrase: This study introduces LINEX an algorithm for creating robust explanations similar to the LIME method for complex models. It utilizes the Invariant Risk Minimization Games framework. LIME is known to be influenced by its settings and the paper proposes that a robust version should be insensitive to these parameters.

The study observes that the properties of these invariant predictors (as defined in [2]) make them suitable for explanations. Strengths:  LINEX provides robustness to LIME while maintaining accuracy.  The motivation for using IRM is clearly explained.  Experiments cover various datasets and evaluation metrics. Weaknesses:  LINEX does not significantly outperform MeLime or MAPLE particularly for nontabular data.  MAPLE performs competitively on the MEPS dataset and MeLime is competitive on FMNIST and Rotten Tomatoes.  It is unclear why the paper claims \"Causal\" in the title and elsewhere as no causal support is provided.

They create various local contexts by randomly modifying or producing realistic neighbors through generative or retrieval techniques. Using the suggested method they iteratively create constrained least squares predictors for each setting and the final predictor is the sum of these individual predictors. Experiments on tabular data image and text datasets demonstrate that the proposed method provides superior explanations than existing techniques such as LIME. Overall Evaluation: The paper is well justified and makes a significant contribution. The experimental results strongly support the proposed methods effectiveness. It outperforms LIME SLIME and MeLime in over half of the experiments while achieving comparable performance in the majority of the remaining ones. The paper however lacks a discussion on how weak the results appear in certain experiments such as FMNIST and Rotten Tomatoes. Furthermore the paper would benefit from an error analysis on the proposed method particularly when its performance is inferior to baselines. The paper is wellwritten and wellpresented but I have a few minor comments listed below. Additional Questions and Comments:  Page 3: \"Local explainability setup vs. IRM setup\": The authors state that the model uses features in the explanations that may be irrelevant from a domain perspective but which the model uses for decisionmaking. This could be misleading since these explanations are posthoc and the paper does not establish that the model relies solely on the identified explanations.

Lack of clear evidence supporting this claim.", "Paraphrase: Summary The study investigates creating valuable representations of histological images for categorization. Due to significant domain shifts in histological imaging the classification challenge is defined as fewshot learning (FSL). The authors compare FSL pretraining on a base dataset using complete supervision and contrastive learning in their experiments. During lowshot training they employ an unsupervised method for data augmentation in the latent space (\"latent augmentation\"). Contrastive learning with latent augmentation according to the findings delivers the most reliable representations particularly for outofdomain tasks. Strengths and Weaknesses Strengths  The study focuses on a key obstacle that prevents the implementation of MLbased pipelines in histological image analysis: issues with outofdomain adaptation particularly when introducing a new label set.  The proposed approach which heavily leverages recent advances in FSL and data augmentation techniques is appealing and convincing.  The experimental section is exhaustive and wellthoughtout. There are three distinct adaptation scenarios with varying levels of required domain adaptation. Weaknesses  Lack of originality: While the methods are integrated and utilized in a novel manner none of them (contrastive and fullysupervised classification domain adaptation using FSL) are truly original. The exception could be \"latent augmentation\" which unlike most others does not require labels and extends the approach of earlier latent space augmentation techniques. This aspect piques interest but because the studies are limited to histological images its broader impact on image categorization is unknown.  Potentially dubious conclusion: The authors assert that \"to our astonishment we demonstrate that stateoftheart CL models generalize significantly better than their supervised peers for histological pictures.\" In their Analysis they say \"FSP (fully supervised pretraining) tends to overfit severely at a high level because to the lack of dominant objectiveness whereas CLP (contrastive learning pretraining) can capture general patterns from roughly spread tissues. We believe this is the primary cause for CLP models outperforming FSP models in pathology.\" I see this as more of a statement about the observed result than an explanation. Furthermore Im not convinced the results presented by Chen and Li (2020) can be directly compared to these as they relate to the same comparison but are done in an outofdomain (i.e. previously unseen class) setting. It would be more likely for FSPlearned representations to be unreliable when encountering a patch with an unseen class. On the other hand CLPs goal is to discover similarities and differences in photos which should result in more classagnostic midlevel features. I would like to see a more indepth analysis of this comparison.

The paper introduces a projected power method (PPower) algorithm that is similar to iterative hard thresholding when w is sparse. It shows that PPower ensures a monotonic increase in the objective value at each iteration. Under certain assumptions (a gap between the largest and second largest eigenvalues of V and a bounded perturbation bound) the paper provides guarantees for the algorithms optimization performance in three settings: the spiked Wigner model spiked covariance model and phase retrieval. Specifically it shows that the distance between the global optimum and the PPower solution is bounded by certain factors involving the number of iterations dimension and spectral gap of V. Additionally it provides conditions for a linear convergence rate under a good initialization and other assumptions typically satisfied in practical settings (e.g. positive range of the GAN).

Specifically given a Lipschitz function G that maps from the kdimensional Euclidean space \\mathbb Rk to \\mathbb R(G) the authors seek to identify a vector w within the range R(G) that maximizes wT V w. Here V \\barV E denotes a noisy version of the groundtruth positive semidefinite matrix \\barV and \\barx is the top eigenvector of \\barV. The generative model G is assumed to have a range within the unit ball of \\mathbb Rn and the error matrix E is constrained such that for any sets S1 and S2 with size m \\Omega( \\log( S1 S2)) s1T E s2 \\leq \\sqrt \\log(S1 S2) m \\s1\\2 \\s2\\2. This error constraint is satisfied by the spiked covariance and phase retrieval models under the condition that the sample size m is sufficiently large. The authors establish two key results: 1. They demonstrate that under the aforementioned assumptions the global optimizer \\hatv of wT V w constrained on R(G) has an error relative to the groundtruth solution \\barx bounded by \\\\hatv \\barx\\2 \\leq \\sqrtk \\log Lm. 2. They show that the power iteration algorithm augmented with a projection step onto the constraint set R(G) converges to a vector with a similar error bound. Experimental results on the spiked covariance and phase retrieval problems using the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets suggest that incorporating this projection step into the power iteration enhances recovery when G is a pretrained variational autoencoder with a small latent dimension k. Strengths and Weaknesses: The work generalizes both standard PCA and coneconstrained PCA in the presence of generative priors. The study of PCA and power iteration beyond convex settings is relevant. However the main theoretical results are primarily statistical focusing on the sample complexity of the global maximizer and power iteration given the availability of an oracle for projecting points onto nonconvex sets. Theorem 1 (bounding the global maximums sample complexity) relies on standard concentrationcover arguments while the convergence result (Theorem 2) for the power iteration is less surprising given prior work on nonconvex settings.

It demonstrates success in identifying roles within sentences. To achieve this a neural network compresses input into a set of independent hidden variables. The VAE framework ensures that these variables adhere to a standard Gaussian distribution. A Transformer encoderdecoder is utilized as the inference network. This network decodes latent variables which are then used as input to the transformer encoders outputs to establish relationships. The underlying principle is that sequencetosequence architectures based on attention align source and target sequences. The method is tested on identifying roles in sentences. By altering individual latent variables the authors examine how this affects the roles depicted in the generated text. They also analyze how attention aggregates syntactic roles into latent vectors. Their findings indicate that their method isolates sentence roles into latent variables more effectively than traditional VAEs.

They propose a network with a frontend of recurrent units (ConvGRU) that processes spatially jittered and downsampled images mimicking an active sensor. The network is structured as a studentteacher framework where a temporal pooling layers weights are trained to match those of a feature layer in ResNet50. Finetuning then improves classification accuracy. The authors investigate whether spatiotemporal calculations can generate a feature layer comparable to a larger network trained on fullresolution images and how this layer supports object recognition at a level similar to ResNet50. They find that their network performs almost as well as ResNet50 with 4x downsampled and jittered images. They also demonstrate that the network engages in spatiotemporal calculations. Strengths 1. Innovative Concept: The use of an \"active sensor\" approach where the input image is jittered is novel and aligns with recent research in neuroscience and psychology. 2. Promising Results: The initial experimental findings show the networks strong performance especially with jittered images arranged in a spiral pattern. Major Issues 1. Questionable Evidence for Spatiotemporal Significance: The authors claim that spatiotemporal computations in the network frontend are crucial but the evidence supporting this is limited. The comparison between their ResNetRNN network which has recurrent computations after global average pooling and their DRC network shows that ResNetRNN performs poorly. However the comparison is not equitable because ResNetRNN uses vanilla GRU units limiting its access to spatial information. Additionally the training method for ResNetRNN is unclear. 2. Underanalyzed Spatiotemporal Computations: Figure 2 illustrates that the DRC network utilizes a combination of spatial and temporal computations but this aspect is insufficiently analyzed. It is unclear whether the performance varies with the distribution of computations across different units or what the impact of removing specific units would be. 3. Limited Exploration of Trajectory Significance: The claim that the temporal trajectory of images is important (Fig. 3) is not adequately supported. The authors do not analyze the effect of curvature in the trajectories and the results could be influenced by the increased overlap of curved trajectories near the center. A control experiment that randomizes the trajectories could determine whether the statistics of the trajectories or the curvature contribute more to performance. Minor Issues 1.

This feature is particularly beneficial for tasks like BIO tagging which require sequences to adhere to the O(BIO) format. Unlike general CRFs RegCCRFs lack hidden states making them more powerful.

The theorems in Section 5 are intuitive and Theorem 1s proof could be moved to an appendix to save space. The experiments in Section 6 are interesting but could explore formally proving that CRFs cannot generate specific string relations. There is a suspected typo in Theorem 2 where the inequality sides are identical. The method enhances semantic role labeling but not dramatically when compared to using RoBERTa.

This assumption simplifies training but constrains the models expressiveness particularly for longer sequences. To address this limitation a novel method is proposed to constrain the CRF output space to be within a regular language. This approach allows the model to capture longrange dependencies. The method involves constructing a constrained CRF from a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) by setting specific transition and emission probabilities to zero. To improve efficiency the authors introduce techniques for minimizing NFAs and leveraging equivalence classes to reduce the number of tags. They also discuss the relation between constrained CRFs and weighted finite state transducers (FSTs) highlighting advantages of the former. Unlike previous constrained CRF variants this approach trains directly within the constrained space minimizing the negative loglikelihood against the actual data distribution. This enables better performance for regular language outputs. Synthetic experiments demonstrate the models ability to capture nonlocal dependencies and distributions more effectively than models with constrained decoding.

However the authors contest certain claims made in the literature regarding steganography such as its superiority to other multimedia security problems and the feasibility of embedding 0.4 bits per pixel without detection. They also note that the proposed method is not stateoftheart in terms of mainstream steganography and that alternative approaches exist with better detectability. The paper acknowledges the use of clipping to prevent excessive pixel differences and outofrange values but suggests that clipping values between 0 and 255 would be more practical. It also emphasizes the importance of evaluating steganography quality based on detectability rather than reconstruction errors.

The analysis indicates that the Bayesian posterior is not suitable for OOD detection because:  Exact inference in infinitely wide networks (GPs) using common architectural choices may not result in desirable OOD performance.  The choice of weightspace prior significantly influences OOD performance.  There is a tradeoff between good generalization and high uncertainty on OOD. Strengths and Weaknesses:  The paper lacks novelty as the concepts discussed are generally known in the machine learning community.  The high uncertainty in the posterior can be due to insufficient data in certain regions not necessarily indicative of OOD.  Inputdomain agnostic prior knowledge can potentially reduce posterior uncertainty which may not be detrimental to OOD detection.

The authors approach this by examining the properties of BNNs with infinite width from a functionspace perspective. Their analysis suggests that BNNs might not be intrinsically wellsuited for OOD detection. They also argue that there is a tradeoff between OOD generalization and uncertainty. Finally they propose a new approach for evaluating the OOD properties of models. Strengths and Weaknesses The wellwritten and accessible paper addresses a timely topic. The authors observations have significant implications for the field and have been largely overlooked. However the paper could be improved in several areas. Criticisms:  The paper focuses primarily on regression tasks with classification tasks being approached through regression. However most OOD detection studies involving BNNs have used classification tasks. It would be beneficial to include experiments using logistic regression for classification.  The examples used are mostly lowdimensional and simplified. While this is not a major issue using more complex problems would strengthen the paper.  The authors briefly mention OOD generalization but do not elaborate. Recent studies have focused on evaluating methods on OOD datasets like CIFAR10C. The authors proposed method for validating OOD properties in Section 7 needs more detail and experimental validation.  There are references missing or could be discussed such as the work on NNGP equivalence for deep networks and a recent study proposing a BNN prior for improving OOD generalization.

Using both infinitewidth (allowing for exact inference due to an equivalent representation as a Gaussian process) and finitewidth networks (requiring approximate inference) the study demonstrates empirical findings that challenge this assumption. The study makes several observations:  Exact inference in infinitewidth networks does not guarantee desirable OOD behavior. For instance the standard deviation of the posterior function obtained from an infinitewidth 2layer ReLU network does not align with the true datagenerating process making it unsuitable for OOD detection.  This observation holds true for corresponding finitewidth networks. Strengths:  The study encompasses both infinitewidth and finitewidth networks in its analysis.

To solve this structured problem the paper formulates it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develops a variant of the UCRL2 algorithm which learns to recommend the optimal arm for each congestion state.

In this situation an arms reward relies on how frequently it has been selected within the last \u0394 time units. The authors extended congested bandits to graphbased and contextual versions. New algorithms were created for these settings and upper bounds for regret were obtained comparable to those for MABs or linear contextual bandits. Specifically for congested bandits the upper bound is approximately O(\u221aK\u0394T) with K representing the number of arms and T the time horizon. For graphbased congested bandits it is roughly O(\u221aVE\u0394T) where V and E are the number of nodes and edges respectively.

The authors propose a new missingness mechanism called \"mixed confounded missingness\" (MCM) which encompasses missingness that both influences treatment selection and is influenced by it.

Weakness: The mapping between Figure 1(d) and Figure 3 in the paper may be incorrect. In Figure 1(d) the relationship W \u2192 Z2 \u2192 X2 \u2190 X implies that W determines the missingness of Z2 and subsequently the observed values of X2. However it does not necessarily mean that W also determines X2 when missing values are not present. In the example given missing values in X2 for participants of a job training program are created due to additional information provided by participants that is not available for nonparticipants. Imputing the missing values in X2 perfectly would break the relationship W \u2192 X2 making Figure 1(d) equivalent to Figure 1(c). Consequently the discussion on \"selective imputation\" based on Figure 3 may be flawed.

Method: The paper demonstrates that attention weights can exhibit correlations with social stereotypes. To mitigate this bias the method assigns each sample with pairs of words representing the groups for which bias mitigation is targeted. These augmented samples are used for training forcing the model to attend to tokens within the augmented portions. The attention weights are then adjusted to achieve similarity between weights attending on tokens relevant to the augmented groups. To prevent semantic changes the attention weights for the original sample tokens are constrained to follow those of an unaltered model trained simultaneously. Additionally negative sampling using random words is employed to augment training data and all attention weights are forced to align with those of the teacher model.

This work addresses both simultaneously providing valuable theoretical tools. However the framework currently only considers fully connected and convolutional layers leaving open the extension to more complex architectures like skip connections or transformers. While the empirical evaluation serves to illustrate the theory it may not fully reflect practical implementations. Nevertheless the work makes an important contribution by addressing these issues for fully connected and convolutional layers. Questions and Responses: 1.

Analysis of batch normalization: Our theory (based on Proposition 3.6) does not explicitly analyze batch normalization. However we empirically observe that batch normalization does not significantly affect the robustness properties of IBPDEQs. 4. Definition of \\widetildeW: The symbol \\widetildeW used in the proof of Lemma 3.4 is a variant of the matrix W. It is defined by \\widetildeW  (IW)1(IW). This notation is standard in matrix analysis and should be clarified in the paper. 5. Derivation of (3.8) in the proof of Lemma 3.4: (3.8) is obtained by applying the following identity: ``` (IA)1  I  A(IA)1 ``` to the equation ``` (IW)1  (IW)1  2W(IW)1 ``` with A  W. 6.

The authors formulate the problem as a constrained optimization where the objective is to maximize the discounted rewards while ensuring that the difference between the target states (from the policy) and the actual states (from the environment using the control models action) is below a specified threshold. The optimization is solved using the Lagrange multiplier method. Experiments are conducted in various domains and with different stateoftheart DRL algorithms. Strengths and Weaknesses  The authors observe that during learning if the buffer of samples becomes full no new samples are added. This applies to both the inverse control model (ICM) and the learning of Q and \u03c0.

The Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC) method is introduced which estimates accuracy as the percentage of unlabeled target examples that the model confidently predicts. Experiments demonstrate ATCs superiority over existing methods in various model architectures and distribution shifts. Theoretical Framework: Predicting accuracy is shown to be as challenging as finding the best predictor. The effectiveness of prediction methods relies on assumptions about the nature of the distribution changes between source and target domains.

The paper begins by explaining that accurately predicting test accuracy without making assumptions about the specific differences between the training and test datasets is impossible. ATC overcomes this challenge by assuming that the distribution shift follows a certain pattern. ATC sets a threshold (t) on a score function based on the error rate in the training data. It then estimates the error rate in the test data as the number of samples with scores below the threshold. This process is performed without using any labels from the test data. Experiments show that ATC outperforms other methods on a variety of datasets and distribution shifts. However the choice of score function for ATC is not clear with both max confidence (ATCMC) and negative entropy (ATCNE) performing best in different situations. ATC is comparable to a regression model that uses labeled data from the test set for accuracy estimation. Temperature rescaling while preserving the classifications of the model can significantly alter the ordering of sample scores. The reason for this is unclear and the paper does not provide specific examples of how temperature rescaling improves performance. Finally the paper highlights that all methods for estimating test accuracy require assumptions about the distribution shift between the training and test datasets.

In this algorithm the central device selects the local device that produces the least loss during aggregation. The paper offers theoretical and experimental evidence to support the claim that this alphaweighting mechanism enhances FATs inner maximization ability. Strengths and Weaknesses: While the alphaweighting mechanism shows improvements some claims in the paper raise concerns.  The paper attributes performance issues in FAT to biased adversarial sample generation on local devices. However adversarial samples are inherently biased during training since local devices do not have access to the optimal model parameters.  The paper suggests that hardertotrain local devices may \"overoptimize\" their models. Its unclear if \"overoptimize\" refers to overfitting.

Hyperparameter tuning for \u03b1 has a significant impact on model performance but the selection or estimation of \u03b1 is not clearly explained.

The selector (g) identifies the input category. The paper introduces a novel loss function (W) to train the selector (g) given a predictor (f). This function uses the difference between the prediction (f(x)) and label (y) as a proxy for gs desired output (0 for uninformative 1 for informative). The weight of this difference is adjusted based on the relative prevalence of informative and uninformative data. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that if the indicator empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem can be solved the proposed method can achieve low selective risk (error on classified data) and good accuracy for the selector (g) under certain conditions.

It leverages extensive datasets of degraded (blurry) and highquality (sharp) image pairs for training. The method stems from the idea that a properly deblurred image should not retain any signs of its original blur. To exploit this principle the method incorporates a secondary network that attempts to add blur back to the deblurred image aiming to replicate the blur of the original image. If the deblurred image is truly restored this reblurring attempt should fail. These two networks perform roles similar to a generator and discriminator in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) though their underlying mechanisms differ. The reblurring network outputs an image that is assessed against a reference image (the original sharp image). The method employs three loss terms: one for assessing blur (Lblur) one for promoting sharpness (Lsharp) and another for reblurring (Lreblur) in addition to the standard L1 loss used to compare the deblurred and sharp images. Furthermore the method proposes a postprocessing technique that leverages the reblurring network to enhance deblurring results for specific images. It involves approximately reversing the reblurring network through gradient descent optimization. Experiments and Results: Experiments demonstrate the methods effectiveness in improving deblurring outcomes compared to existing methods using popular synthetic datasets (GoPro and REDS) and a realworld image dataset (Lai et al. 2016). Quantitative metrics (PSNR SSIM LPIPS NIQE) and visual comparisons support the findings. Strengths and Limitations:  The method is founded on a novel and intriguing observation. Its formulation appears to harness this observation effectively.  Empirical results indicate superior performance compared to competing methods.  The reblurring networks potential to address outofdistribution challenges is intriguing.  The formulation relies heavily on multiple loss terms suggesting potential for refinement and simplification.  The methods applicability beyond deblurring is not fully explored in the research.  The analysis lacks depth leaving questions about the methods advantages over simpler alternatives and potential improvements through iterative deblurring. Additional Observations:  The description of \"inherent limitations of PSNRoriented solutions\" should be clarified potentially referring to the \"regressiontomean\" issue.  Additional relevant work on perceptual losses and referencebased metrics could be incorporated to enhance the discussion.  Figure 1 requires clarification on the content of the top and bottom rows for each method.  The reblurring module acts as an inverse of the deblurring module and presenting it as such could clarify its role.  The writing could benefit from further organization and clarity particularly regarding the introduction of the \"reblurring loss.\"  The justification for using the pseudosharp image \\hatS instead of S should be supported by evidence and aligned with the evaluation metrics used.

Weaknesses: Dynamic tree quantization and stable embedding methodology are reasonable but not surprising. Dynamic tree quantization is modified which seems to be reasonably motivated. Appendix E supports the argument despite implicit assumptions. These assumptions should be thoroughly discussed in the appendix. Question: 1. Why image tasks do not have as much saving as NLP tasks In Table 1 Imagerelated tasks savings are marginal versus NLPrelated tasks. Is there a way to make this work for Image speech tasks as well"], "zPLQSnfd14w": ["Paraphrased Statement: This paper analyzes the Rademacher complexity of the family of Euclidean metrics learned through an Llayer neural network with Lipschitz activation functions. The proof leverages an \\epsilonnet for the embedding network devised by Barlett Foster and Telgarsky (2017). This net allows for the construction of a net for the metric space with only a constant alteration. Standard arguments are then employed to bound the Rademacher complexity. Specifically for Metric Learning: For the metric learning scenario the paper demonstrates an improvement over Bartlett Foster and Telgarskys bounds by considering the density of the last network layer. The authors argue that this dense layer setting is frequently encountered in practice. Additionally their bound aligns with known bounds for linear cases. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths:  The authors enhance Bartlett Foster and Telgarskys bounds for metric learning settings by examining the last layers density.  Empirical evidence supports the prevalence of the dense last layer setting.  The papers bound aligns with known linear case bounds. Weaknesses:  Despite the improvement the authors believe it may not be substantial due to the dependence on the networks depth and width.  The paper lacks discussion on how the bounds relate to generalization error bounds particularly their empirical significance. Questions: 1. The bounds are not completely dimensionfree due to the explicit appearance of the depth L. Additionally increased width can lead to larger matrix norms indicating that both width and depth influence the bound. 2. The magnitude of the matrix norms during training and their impact on the bounds size are unclear. 3. The authors assertion that the complexity must be lower bounded by the square of the operator norms of the matrices is not fully understood. If true it would signify a significant improvement in the bound."], "jJis-v9Pzhj": ["Paraphrased Statement: Summary:  This study examines the Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning problem.  It presents a twostep method for estimating pseudolabel uncertainty allowing for the assignment of more reliable pseudolabels and improved predictive performance.  This estimation method differs from previous approaches. Strengths and Weaknesses:  Assumptions:  The paper assumes a labeled validation set with positive and negative examples for early stopping.  It also assumes known proportions of positive and negative samples.  Both assumptions are not practical in realworld scenarios.  Lack of Comparison:  The paper does not compare its proposed method to existing approaches that do not make these assumptions such as PAN (\"Predictive Adversarial Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data\").  Lack of Comparison with Prior Methods:  The paper acknowledges the existence of earlier pseudolabeling techniques but does not provide an experimental comparison to these approaches to demonstrate the superiority of its proposed method.  Clarity:  The paper is easy to comprehend."], "qrdbsZEZPZ": ["Summary: This paper establishes that differential privacy guarantees certified robustness against poisoning attacks in federated learning scenarios. Strengths:  Correct results  Solid experiments  Comprehensive research from theory to evaluation Weaknesses:  Similar results to prior work ([1]) raising concerns about novelty  Restriction to federated learning setting limits generalizability  Inclusion of instancelevel DP section despite userlevel DP preservation in federated learning applications Overall: The paper is currently not suitable for publication. The authors are advised to revise the presentation to address these concerns."]}
