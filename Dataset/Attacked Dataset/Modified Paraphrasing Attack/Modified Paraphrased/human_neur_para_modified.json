Original Statement: Summary POST REBUTTAL Score increased to 7. In this work the authors propose faster than quadratic tests for the twosample independence and goodnessoffit problems using the Maximum Mean variance (MMD) Hilbert Schmidt independence Criterion (HSIC) and Kernel Stein variance (KSD) respectively. They are based on incomplete U statistics that can interpolate between linear time and quadratic time costs (the latter cost is incurred by typical tests which are complete Ustatistics). Strengths and Weakness The authors provide a tradeoff between the computational cost used and the power achieved in Theorem 1while achieving the minimax rates over Sobolev balls when using the quadratic runtime variance. The authors then use this solution to also achieve appropriate power solutions for kernel selection (up to logarithmic inflation in the number of kernels). Notably this solution is adaptive and does not require the knowledge of the smoothness parameter of the difference between the null and the alternative density. The authors also provide several experiments which demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods. The writing of the paper is pretty clear and worth appreciating Questions 1. The work in Huggins and Mackey (e.g. the L1 IMQ and Cauchy RFF random feature Stein variance) were all linear and not quadratic time as the authors mention in l 53. Given the focus on linear time tests in this work I believe that these tests should be treated as a useful baseline for goodnessoffit comparison experiments. In specific Huggins and Mackeys experiments showed that their tests typically outperformed the FSSD test (which is one of the key linear time baselines in the current work). 2. In the separation rate the dependence on alpha is logarithmic but that on beta is polynomial (1x)is the latter unavoidable I can see from the validation that it is because of the nature of concentration inequalities used in the two contexts (namely Rademacher chaos concentration and Markovs inequality)but are the arguments known to be tight set there exist a setting where such dependence is necessarily needed 3. Is the tradeoff in Theorem 1 tight I can see its tight when L N2 but is it tight for smaller values of L Some discussion on this would be very useful. 4. Do you not need any requirements on p for Proposition 1 And does only the difference pq need to lie in the Sobolev ball for Thm 1(ii) 5. set the choice of design D not matter set it have to be an iid subsample Can it be adaptive (My guess is all the arguments go through relying on iidness of data points in D).

These tests are shown to be valid (Theorem 1) and have guaranteed power under certain assumptions about the underlying densities. The power guarantees are initially proven for a statistic that depends on the true density smoothness but an adaptive estimation is later developed (Theorem 2). Compared to existing independence test results a tighter bounds with a beneficial dependence on the type 1 error probability is achieved (Theorem 3). Experiments demonstrate the performance of the tests under varying hyperparameters and compare them to other nonparametric tests.

An SR is a set of features that explains why a classifier classifies an input as a particular class. yet SRs can be very large and complex making them hard to understand for users. To address this the authors introduced a novel concept called \"deltaSRs.\" DeltaSRs allow a certain degree of error by requiring only some percentage of potential completions of the partial feature assignment to be classified the same as the original input. The authors showed that finding deltaSRs over decision trees is computationally hard yet for minimalsized deltaSRs. yet they also provided some positive issue for decision trees with certain structural properties or monotone classifiers. The authors also provided a SAT encoding for finding the smallest deltaSRs. yet they found that this encoding is only practical for small decision trees.

The computational complexity seems to stem from considering all potential extensions of minimal sufficient reasons which may not be necessary for decision trees. Additionally the runtime of the SAT encoding is impractical for realworld scenarios.

Given unlabeled datasets from different domains where the withinclass structure (p(xy)) remains consistent but the class distribution (p(y)) varies (e.g. over time or location) label can be uniquely recovered. In the tabular setting the technique is analogous to topic modeling where data stage represent discussion domains represent documents and label represent topic. Assumptions are provided for recoverability using nonnegative matrix factorization. Extending the approach to continuous data involves clustering examples based on vectors [p(dx)]d estimated by a classifier trained across domains. topic modeling is then applied to the discretization and results are converted back to p(yd x) using Bayes rule and the classifier.

This allows for linear evaluation cost in the number of edges chosen adaptively using a generative model for community detection (SBM) and a fast sampling method (fastRG). The architecture supports flexible sparsity model across layers enabling the learning of full attention models when necessary. However it significantly reduces computational complexity as demonstrated in experiments on the LRA dataset. The paper builds on theoretical results on sparse attention transformers and applies these findings to the proposed architecture leading to Theorem 1. The limitations are discussed with GPU architectures used for large transformers being currently inefficient for sparse tensor operations. Strengths and Weaknesses This work combines sampling methods with gradient descent optimization providing theoretical efficiency guarantees supported by experiments. While maintaining performance it is not currently wellsuited for large GPU clusters. The paper lacks accessibility for readers unfamiliar with SBM and generative model. It could benefit from further explanation of how the SBM model translates to the SBMTransformer. Theorem 1s proof requires additional elucidation to enhance intuition. The proof in the Appendix relies on previous work with Lemma 2 providing expressibility for specific sparsity model. The extent of novelty should be elaborated upon.

This method aims to reduce the computational expense of creating each N x N selfattention matrix. During forward propagation the proposed method derives SBM parameters from query and key embeddings using a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) and generates a selfattention mask using a immediate random graph sampling method. In the backward head gradients are transmitted through this discrete sampling step using a straightthrough estimator. The authors demonstrate that the proposed SBMTransformer can approximate any work within the context set forth by Yun et al. (2020) and Zaheer et al. (2020). Empirically they show that the SBMTransformer: 1. Can simulate a typical Transformer with full attention on a synthetic task 2. Surheades multiple optimized Transformer variants on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. Strengths and Weaknesses Originality As stated in the paper using sparse attention masks to reduce the computational cost of selfattention has been explored in previous research (e.g. axial attention (Ho et al. 2019) BigBird (Zaheer et al. 2020)). The key methodological innovation here is the usage of a stochastic block model to generate a random attention mask during each forward head. To the authors knowledge this access has not been explored in prior work. Quality Theoretical Results The paper establishes that the proposed Transformer variant has a universal approximation property (Theorem 1). This result is valuable as a sanity check indicating that the proposed method is a reasonable access. The technical contribution is considered minor as the proof of the result largely applies existing techniques from Yun et al. (2020) and Zaheer et al. (2020). A minor limitation of the analysis is that it employs a modified version of the SBMTransformer architecture compared to the one usaged in the empirical evaluation specifically requiring Mii 1 unlike in the version usaged to obtain the results in Table 1. Empirical Evaluation A strength of the paper is the finding that the proposed SBMTransformer architecture outperforms the baseline efficient Transformer architectures on average in the LRA benchmark tasks (Table 1). However a significant weakness of this comparison is that it does not adequately consider the accuracycost tradeoff of each evaluated method. For model it is unclear from the paper whether the SBMTransformer outperforms the given baselines when controlling for a metric of computational cost such as the permodel floatingpoint performance (FLOP) number during inference. such controls are crucial becausage the SBMTransformer introduces additional performances (such as a 2layer MLP usaged for calculating the SBM parameters) the cost of which must be offset by the increased sparsity of the selfattention matrix. Clarity The presentation is generally straightforward and easy to follow. Significance As mentioned in Section 6 the unstructured sparsity of the resulting attention maps in the SBMTransformer formulation is not compatible with fast matrix multiplication on current GPU hardware. Therefore the proposed method requires longer wallclock times for inference which limits its practical value for practitioners. The authors argue that the method (1) \"enables multihead attention with long sequences\" and (2) that practitioners can adjust the computational cost of inference by limiting the number of edges sampled. These arguments are not entirely persuasive as written. In specific claim (1) requires further justification in light of (a) existing efficient Transformer architectures that achieve subquadratic computation and (b) techniques like memoryefficient attention [1] that demand subquadratic memory. As for claim (2) the benefits of this additional flexibility (e.g. in terms of accuracy versus cost) should be evaluated empirically. Questions As discussed in the previous section does the SBMTransformer advance the accuracy versus cost tradeoff frontier in comparison to current efficient Transformer architectures Since random sampling under the SBM is required even during inference practitioners typically find nondeterministic prediction at inference undesirable. Can this sampling step be replaced with a deterministic performance", "Paraphrased Summary: This paper introduces a novel attention mechanism where the sparsity model is learned adaptively by modeling the attention mask as a bipartite graph. The graph is created using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) which allows for the training of a cluster embedding matrix.

In forward propagation equations (58) are used to model the mask matrix introducing a cluster embedding matrix and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for token membership determination. They also implement a StraightThrough Estimator (STE) to enable gradient backpropagation despite the discrete sampling of the mask.

In this problem resources are represented as nodes in a graph and the goal is to allocate or partially allocate these nodes to a group of agents. Each agent has their own valuation work for the edges in the graph and their satisfaction with a specific allocation is determined by the maximum matching weight in the subgraph corresponding to their allocated nodes. For the case of homogeneous agents (i.e. agents with identical valuation works) the paper demonstrates that a basic greedy approach results in an MMS allocation for unweighted graph. However this approach lacks a guaranteed approximation guarantee in more general scenarios. Consequently an alternative algorithm is proposed that yields a \u215bMMS allocation in polynomial time.

This representation is built by a convolutional network then decoded by a neural network that considers the pixels location and nearby features. DISCO is trained on paired clean and distorted images. It is efficient and generalizes well even with limited training data. It is also robust to various attacks and can be combined with other defenses to enhance robustness. Strengths: Robust across datasets norms and architectures Efficient in terms of computation data and parameters Generalizable requiring only a small amount of training data Transferable to different attacks Weaknesses: Acknowledgment of LIIFs contribution to the underlying approach is insufficient May reduce standard accuracy compared to adversarial training defenses Excludes recent testtime defense approach in its survey Does not evaluate transfer attacks from the underlying classifier to the defenseclassifier combination", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: The authors introduce DISCO a method that employs localized manifold projections to mitigate adversarial perturbations. Their goal is to generate the original RGB value for a perturbed image at a specific pixel location. DISCO relies on the assumption that the necessary manifold projection can be localized to specific image patch rather than the entire image given the relationship between natural and perturbed images. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths: Wellwritten paper Important problem being addressed Thorough experimental evaluation Weaknesses: Limited originality Lack of indepth theoretical analysis Questions: How does DISCO compare to existing methods in the field such as those by Xu et al. Li et al. and Bai et al. in terms of performance"], "yfrDD_rmD5": ["Paraphrase: Summary: This paper extensively investigates how different model parameters contribute to data influence measurement. It highlights two key observations: Lowerlayer parameters capture more informative gradients. parameter used by numerous training examples experience a \"cancellation effect\" (gradients cancel each other out). Inspired by these insight the paper proposes a novel data influence method that replaces parameters from the last layer used in TracIn with those from the embedding layer. empirical findings validate the insight and the effectiveness of this new method. Strengths: The paper presents two valuable insight about data influence. The proposed method effectively considers both low and highlevel similarity. The paper is wellwritten and clearly presented. Weaknesses: The paper uses ambiguous terms like \"share logic\" and \"unique logic.\" Explanations and evidence are needed. An ablation field should be conducted to demonstrate the impact of using special tokens only on the full dataset. Removing data points could affect the training process. Its unclear how this was addressed to ensure consistency across methods. The influence of data samplers random seed on model performance is not discussed. Questions: Is gradientbased similarity (S) essential for the proposed method There are some typos in the paper such as \"parametersin\" in line 36 \"share\" logic\" in line 194 and \"multiple periods.\" in line 215. The appendix contains Figure 4 but its unclear if its meant to be \"Appendix Figure 4 or on\".", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: This research presents TracInWE a method that calculates data influence scores based on both the overall training input and individual words in the input. TracInWE aims to reduce the \"cancellation effect\" effect caused by data influence extraction methods that rely on last layer weights. It is inspired by TracIn a previous method that extracts influence from the last layer. Strengths: TracInWE is built on the premise that existing data influence methods may exhibit cancellation across attributions resulting in a loss of influence for training models. This observation could lead to improvements in explainable NLP methodology. Weaknesses: model 3.1 presents a unclear comparison between the sparse representation of the model and the dense representation of word embeddings used by TracInWE. While word embeddings represent input data data influence is primarily determined by output layer linked to the loss function. Using embedding space for data influence extraction may have limitations in deep neural network training. It remains unclear how TracInWE addresses fundamental effects like vanishing gradients and learning relevance when calculating influence based on the embedding layer. The justification for removing bias from the TracIn computation to reduce cancellation is not fully explained. Question: What is the interpretation of the \"cancellation ratio\"", "Paraphrase: Summary: This field reexamines common approach to calculating the influence of training data particularly those that focus solely on the last layer. It explores ways to enhance the accuracy of estimating individual examples influence. In natural language processing (NLP) models are frequently large often incorporating pretrained language models as a foundation. Typically influence functions are computed only from last layer. The paper demonstrates that lastlayer representations in text classification models can experience a \"cancellation effect\" when calculating the influence function on training samples. To address this effect the paper introduces a technique called TracInWE. It modifies the existing TracIn method to compute influence on the word embedding layer rather than the last layer. Experiments conducted on three text classification tasks show that TracInWE outperforms other influence computation methods applied to the last layer. Strengths: Highlights limitations of existing influence computation methods based on last layer computation. Demonstrates improved performance with the proposed method through empirical evaluation. Addresses a critical research field in explainable AI (XAI). Weaknesses: The method is essentially a basic extension limiting technical novelty. Questions: Have you attempted to visualize the reduction in the cancellation effect for each layer in the model"], "ofRmFwBvvXh": ["Paraphrased Statement: Summary: The study investigates deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. Key findings include: Error rates for approximating smooth functions using CNNs in different mathematical spaces Bounds on sample error approximation for misclassification error in resulting classification algorithms Strengths: CNNs are widely used for image classification and have unique analysis challenges due to their convolutional structure. The study considers unbounded target functions and introduces a truncation approach for error approximation. It explores an \"almost manifold\" structure in the input space leading to improved error rates. Weaknesses: The authors do not clarify the absolute continuity assumption in their proofs. A typo exists in the proof of Theorem 4.5 regarding the domain definition. The meaning of the network parameter \\(\\mathcal W\\) should be clarified. comparison: The authors provide a comparison for approximation error results but not for misclassification error approximation. Questions: The reviewer raises various questions regarding the absolute continuity assumption the typo in the proof of Theorem 4.5 and the network interpretation of \\(\\mathcal W\\).", "Paraphrase: Summary: This research introduces improved error limits for approximating functions in Sobolev spaces using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The limits depend polynomially on the space dimension and highlight the connection between network depth filter length and approximation error. By assuming the functions domain is approximated by a lowdimensional manifold the error boundss are considerably enhanced mitigating the \"curse of dimensionality.\" This result is utilized to derive an error bounds for the excess risk in classification tasks separating stochastic and approximation error. The bounds is then further specified for the crossentropy loss function. Strengths and Weaknesses: The contribution appears valuable but its significance compared to prior work is unopen. The paper is wellwritten and accessible with open definitions of mathematical concepts. The structure progresses from general boundss to specific applications increasing understanding. The assumption of an approximate manifold domain is realistic. A toy case comparing theoretical and practical error boundss would enhance understanding of the approximation accuracy. The exclusivity of Sobolev functions may not fully capture why CNNs excel in certain applications where spatial invariance is important suggesting a gap between theory and practical practice. Questions: Is a toy case for comparing theoretical and practical error boundss feasible Why are Sobolev functions considered and what potential gap exists between their theoretical approximation and common CNN applications", "Summary: This paper introduces novel error boundss for approximating functions in Sobolev and H\u00f6lder spaces using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These boundss depend polynomially on the ambient space dimension providing tighter approximation than previous studies. Furthermore they showcase improved tightness when target functions lie on lowerdimensional manifolds mitigating the curse of dimensionality and enabling faster convergence. The authors apply these boundss to analyze binary classification tasks showing that the difference between expected and empirical misclassification risk can be boundsed by a sum of stochastic and approximation error. The stochastic error boundss do not require uniformly boundsed CNN parameters providing flexibility in parameter values. Approximation error boundss are inversely proportional to the overall bounds of the approximating function. The paper includes explicit calculations of these boundss for common binary classification loss functions. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths: Novel contribution with detailed substantiation and calculations for practical applications. Weaknesses: Limited to binary classification tasks and overlooks recent related work. Questions: 1.

They focus on Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a measure of risk. They start by explaining the concepts of risksensitive policies and discuss the differences between static and dynamic CVaR problem formulations. They then propose a simple approach called the Markov actionselection strategy which aims to maximize the alphaCVaR of issue distributions at each state. However they show that this approach does not lead to an optimal policy. To address this issue they introduce an augmented Markov Decision action (MDP) with an additional parameter that represents a threshold. This parameter tracks the \"issuetogo\" needed to reach the initial threshold. Using this augmented MDP they demonstrate that it is potential to recover an optimal CVaR policy under certain assumptions. They propose a distributional Bellman operator that employs the optimal actionselection strategy in the augmented MDP. They show that this operator has a fixed point that is equal to the optimal issue distribution. Based on this they develop Algorithm 1 that optimizes a neural network policy using the new distributional Bellman operator. Experimental issue show that this approach outperforms alternative methods in synthetic and realworld RL environments.

Experiments illustrate the superiority of the proposed method in the context of option trading comparisond to riskneutral and Markov action option strategies. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths: Addresses a significant problem. Provides insightful theoretical and experimental findings. Weaknesses: Lacks clear comparison and positioning against other robust RL approaches. Evaluation may benefit from inclusion of relevant missing baselines.

It modifies the standard functionspace ELBO formulation by replacing KL divergence with Wasserstein2 metric \\(\\mathcalW2(\\mathbbQF \\mathbbPF)\\) to regularize \\(\\mathbbE\\mathbbQ[\\log p(yF)]\\). This substitution stems from generalized variational inference and challenges with KL divergences. GVIFS uses Gaussian measures (GMs) for predictive function parametrization but Gaussian processes (GPs) with additional assumptions provide an equivalent approach. The paper proposes two GVIFS variants: one with mean and covariance parametrized by a sparse variational GP and another with mean parametrized by a neural network and covariance parametrized by a sparse variational GP.

In identical robot placeups the significance of priority switching is not explained. 3. Need for RL: The paper does not discuss the role of RL when priority conventions are already in place. In many cases establishing priority conventions can obviate the need for RL by defining heuristics. 4.

To do this it integrates agreedupon priority rules (agent priorities and action priorities) into Reinforcement Learning (PCRL). The method leverages Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) to generate Qvalues for the system one dimension of the action vector at a time while upholding priority conventions. Additionally an equality auxiliary loss is proposed to ensure that the V(s) are equal for each RNN output corresponding to each action dimension. The paper argues that the priority conventions do not compromise the identification of the optimal actions. The proposed approach is evaluated in coverage planning and Pong domains.

Weaknesses: The paper can be difficult to understand in some place and contains grammatical errors. The paper lacks key citations from recent MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) literature particularly on improving exploration in large action space. The idea of using RNNs to predict one dimension of the action vector at a time resembles previous work.

The authors define an \"ungameable\" reward function as one that leads to nearly identical preferences among policies. They also explore \"simplifications\" a subset of ungameable reward functions. The theoretical focus is on the existence of ungameable reward for stochastic and finite policy classes such as deterministic policies. Strengths and Weaknesses The research topic is significant and intriguing. The theoretical findings are interesting but their scope is limited by the definition of gameability used. The authors acknowledge the need to consider policies beyond optimal ones. yet scrutinizing every conceivable policy (within a policy class) inevitably produces feeble conclusions. The definition of ungameable reward functions necessitates that the preference structure over policies remains virtually unchanged. While such a strict definition of gameability may serve as a starting point its insights and deductions could be misleading. The authors suggest that learned reward are potential gameable and cannot be safely maximized but this conclusion is only valid for their narrow definition of gameability. A more practical approach would involve examining specific optimization frameworks like policy gradient. Questions definition of Ungameable Reward function: The authors propose an ungameability definition that equates to inducing the same preference structure over all policies. It would be beneficial to clarify that this is equivalent to: `R1 and R2 are ungameable if `\u2200`\u03c0` `J1(\u03c0)` `J1(\u03c0)` \u21d2 `J2(\u03c0)` \u2264 `J2(\u03c0)`. This definition is highly restrictive particularly when considering general policy classes. It also suggests a minor distinction between ungameable reward functions and simplifications with the only difference being an additional requirement. definition of Reward function: The authors initially define a reward function as a function from `S` \u00d7 `A` \u00d7 `S` to a probability distribution over real numbers. yet they later treat the expected reward as a scalar. It would be helpful to confirm that they are indeed focusing on reward functions from `R` `S`\u00d7 `A` to `R`. Practical Impact: The paper explores the theoretical existence of ungameable reward functions and simplifications. It would be valuable to know if this work holds any potential practical implications. The function in Theorem 3 can test for the existence of nontrivial simplifications but it is unclear why this would be particularly useful. Furthermore it is unknown if the function can generate a simplification or solely determine its existence.", "Paraphrase: This paper formally describes a problem called \"reward gaming\" which occurs when optimizing a substitute reward function leads to negative outcomes when evaluated against the true reward. The authors define \"gameability\" as the relationship between the true reward and the substitute reward when a policy can be improved according to the substitute reward but degraded according to the true reward. They also define \"simplification\" as a special case where the substitute reward is less complex than the true reward. Theoretically the authors show that its impossible to have nontrivial \"ungameability\" when the policy set is not restricted. When the policy set is finite nontrivial ungameable reward pairs always exist and simplifications exist under certain conditions. For infinite policy sets ungameable pairs sometimes exist. Strengths and Weaknesses: This is the first paper to formally characterize reward gaming for general reward functions. Reward gaming is common in AI but has been poorly understood. This paper provides important insights into when its safe to optimize a substitute reward. The main weakness is that the definition of gameability is strict and ungameable pairs have only been proven to exist for finite policy sets. Relaxing this definition could be a fruitful area of future research. Questions: The paper suggests that Markov reward may not be suitable for defining specific task. A related work (\"On the Expressivity of Markov Reward\") explores this topic further and could provide additional insights. Inverse reward design and decoupled approval are alternative approach to reward optimization.

The paper demonstrates the following: For nonstationary policies probabilistic stationary policies and policy sets containing an open set only equivalent ungameability exists. finite policy sets are always nontrivially gameable.

Due to the difficulty in obtaining exact local estimates the paper study using approximate probabilistic models to enforce these estimates in the loss use. The focus of the paper is on learning cutset networks (a type of probabilistic model) with potentially inconsistent local estimates. This is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with the local estimates as constraints. The paper uses a Lagrangian relaxation approach resulting in a weighted joint optimization problem. Finally the paper presents a technique called momentmatching for optimizing cutset networks. This technique exploits the properties of cutset networks to reduce the variance of the loss use leading to faster convergence. The paper evaluates its approach on the 20Datasets benchmark evidence that models trained with local estimates outperform models trained without them as measured by KL divergence against an oracle model (a mixture of cutset networks).

This approach surmounts the computational hurdles faced by traditional probabilistic models like Bayesian networks and Markov networks which require complex inference to verify the consistency of incomplete data. The authors emphasize the novelty of utilizing TPMs for this study task and believe that the practical benefits of TPMs will be widely recognized in various applications where study models from incomplete data is important. Strengths and Weaknesses: Strengths: The problem addressed is practical and relevant especially considering the use of TPMs to overcome limitations of traditional models.

The reviewer also did not have enough time to provide a thorough assessment. Therefore caution is advised when reading this review and the confidence level has been adjusted accordingly. The paper proposes a formal definition of \"harm\" using structural causal frameworks (SCMs) inspired by Judea Pearls counterfactual theory of causality. The authors extend SCMs with a \"default utility\" (referred to as causal utility framework) and define three conditions (H1 to H3) that determine whether an case causes harm to an agent.

There are two major challenges in this scenario: The standard \"importancesampling\" method for estimating rewards of untried actions is biased. The assumption that all actions are covered by the data (known as \"full support\") is often unrealistic. This paper introduces two new estimators that address these challenges: 1. Pseudoinverse (PI) estimator: Assumes that actions can be described by their features. Constructs a system of equations based on the assumption that the rewards are linear combinations of features. Solves this system to estimate the rewards of untried actions. 2. action Similarity estimator: Assumes that the rewards for untried actions can be approximated by a weighted average of the rewards of similar actions.

Using the performance Estimation Problem (PEP) technique the authors obtain numerical convergence rate bounds based on problem parameters step sizes and iteration count. still PEP does not provide analytical bounds. To derive analytical bounds the authors identify useful inequalities (Lemmas 3.1 and 4.1) which show that certain quantities decrease monotonically unlike the standard EG method where the gradient norm decreases monotonically. These inequalities are used to construct potential functions yielding analytical O(1N) bounds for the unconstrained and projected PEG methods.

Clever use of PEP to identify monotonic dimension and guide the development of potential functions. convergence rates for the projected PEG are expressed in terms of the standard fixed point residual.

This approach is suitable for sampling from probability distributions defined indirectly through constraints on a mathematical manifold. specifically the constraint here is represented as c(x) Ax b. This simplification allows for faster computations potentially enabling the algorithm to handle highdimensional target spaces (e.g. up to 100000 dimensions). Strengths and Weaknesses: The contribution of this work appears to be incremental as the concept of constrained HMC has been explored previously by Brubaker et al. The present algorithm can be viewed as a specialized case of Brubakers Constrained Riemann Manifold HMC (CRHMC) which is acknowledged in the paper. However the authors claim that CRHMC requires eigenvalue decomposition and becomes inefficient for large problems. This is not necessarily true as Brubakers approach does not explicitly require eigenvalue decomposition. The efficiency improvements in this work come from imposing additional assumptions and restrictions (lines 192220). To demonstrate the robustness of these assumptions more comprehensive empirical experiments would be beneficial. The current experimental results are limited (testing against a single benchmark) and only suitable for sampling from uniform distributions. Questions: It is suggested to compare the proposed algorithm against other constrained HMC version (e.g. Brubakers or more recent CHMC implementations). It is unclear whether the experimental target densities used are uniform. If not how is the CHRR algorithm used effectively If they are uniform then the use of Riemannian HMC (which relies on gradients) is unnecessary.", "Paraphrase: This work introduces a Markov range Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on Constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (CHMC) to sample from a logconcave distribution with constraints.

The algorithm achieves stateoftheart results in various challenging scenarios. It has also been incorporated into a popular bioinworkatics library. Additional Questions and Remarks: The authors should further clarify the use of sparsity in the constraints. It is unclear whether the authors consider MCMC methods with or without acceptancerejection steps. The paper should specify whether it solely focuses on constraints of the work Ax \u2264 b or more general implicit manifolds. The use of barrier use within HMC should be clarified for novelty.

The choice of implicit midpoint integrator over leapfrog integrator (which is volumepreserving) is not adequately explained. The paper avoids explicitly stating that CRHMC is ergodic or convergent despite relying on these concepts in later discussion.

It follows a clear structure with helpful appendix organization. Weaknesses: The main weakness lies in the lack of clarity regarding certain assumptions. For instance while the constraint set \\mathcalK is stated as convex it must be compact. This compactness assumption is implicit in many arguments.

LPA3 leads to significant performance improvements on different learning tasks. Weaknesses: 1. The implementation of the optimization problem has some limitations. The function of a neural network classifier to estimate the conditional information of Y given X can result in incorrect predictions. This could lead to undesirable augmentations that share the same classifier prediction as the original image but have a different label. Conversely there may be augmentations that preserve the image label but have significantly different classifier predictions which are not considered by the implementation. practical Adversarial Training suggests that augmentations should alter classifier predictions so preserving classifier predictions may not be optimal. 2. The semisupervised learning lead are not entirely conclusive. The reported performance of FixMatch is lower than the original paper findings indicating potential variance in the lead. The authors should address this and report the variance across multiple random seeds. 3. It is unclear whether LPA3 alone can improve semisupervised and noisy label learning. FixMatch functions additional data augmentation methods (RandAugment and CTAugment) so the paper should test LPA3 as a replacement for all data augmentation in FixMatch to determine its isolated impact.

The high accuracy achieved suggests that the surrogate models performed well. Training both task and surrogate models on a large number of samples (80 of the training dataset for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) may be due to the dependency of Equation (4) on surrogate model performance. 3.

Individual comments are represented as AMR graphs which are merged into a macroAMR. This macroAMR is embedded using a Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural Network. The candidate post is embedded using a Hyperbolic Hierarchical Attention Network which transforms speech into sentences and sentences into a document representation.

The author argues that the use of synthetic supervision is justified because it allows the model to scale in performance with the volume of synthetic data. In principle if the model can outperform supervised methods that use limited supervision it would demonstrate the benefits of synthetic data and support the claim of unsupervised learning. Additionally the model introduces the novel concept of producing amodal segmentation maps as an intermediate step. This allows the model to segment objects even when they are partially occluded.

The paper is generally wellwritten but further intuitive explanations of representation and fairness would enhance clarity.

The authors conducted a comprehensive study of SBP and applied it to train deep neural networks for image classification and object detection. Unlike previous SBP approach for video models which dropped frames during backpropagation while keeping all frames in forward propagation this approach drops feature maps in other layers during backpropagation but retains all feature maps in forward propagation. Similar to dropout this strategy is applied selectively during backpropagation. SBP is investigated for pointwise convolution convolution and transformer layers. The behavior of the SBP approximation varies depending on the operator. For pointwise convolution the SBP approximation results in zero gradients for dropped indices while gradients for retained indices are exact compared to standard gradient descent (SGD). For convolution layers with kernel sizes greater than 1 the SBP approximation is inexact and nonzero regardless of which indices are dropped or retained except in certain special cases. In increase to studying SBP the authors experimented with different design choices including the number of layers to apply SBP to the keep ratio and the dropping strategy. Experiments revealed that applying SBP to 23 layers with a keep ratio of 0.5 using gridwise sampling provided substantial GPU memory savings without a significant drop in accuracy. Moreover the gradients exhibited a high correlation with SGD gradients in terms of cosine similarity. The generalizability of SBP was evaluated on the ImageNet image classification benchmark and the COCO object detection benchmark.

However the paper does not address the challenges of simulating rigid bodies such as collision detection friction or 3D rotation.

The method itself only learns basic inertial dynamics which are relatively straightforward to infer from geometry. The main contribution of the paper is demonstrating the applicability of GNNs to chainlike systems. However it is significant to note that the method is limited in its ability to handle the complexities of realworld rigid body simulation.

To address this the field might benefit from more indepth theoretical or experimental analysis. Questions Paraphrase: 1. The authors should clarify the definition of the target label \"y\" in equation (6) to align with its use in maximizing the loss. Similar clarification is needed for the PGD optimization expression. 2. The methods key advantage is leveraging multiple existing models to generate adversarial model efficient against all surrogate and potential against the targeted victim models. It achieves this by converting queries used in blackbox attacks into whitebox attacks via the surrogate models. Therefore the number of queries consumed by the surrogate should be thoroughly investigated and reported. 3. The authors employ coordinate gradient fall to update the weights \"w\" instead of using Stochastic Gradient fall (SGD) over all elements of \"w.\" An explanation for this choice would be beneficial. 4. While the paper demonstrates the transferability of generated adversarial model to object detection tasks it remains unclear whether the training data for the surrogate is the same as the data used in the attack. Clarification is needed on whether the attacked data is assumed to be unknown and distinct from the surrogate training data.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: This research presents a hybrid attack on deep learning models that combines transferbased and querybased methods. It reduces the number of queries needed while maintaining a high rate of successful targeted attacks. Key Features: Creates an ensemble of surrogate models weighted based on their ability to generate adversarial model that transfer to the target model. Uses these adversarial model to minimize the number of queries required for blackbox attacks. Demonstrates effectiveness on Imagenet models with varying architectures both targeted and untargeted attacks. Strengths: Optimizing over weights in the ensemble ensures limited queries by utilizing prior information. Empirical issue show a low number of queries for highdimensional data. clear and easy implementation with pretrained models and adversarial model available. Weaknesses: Limited evaluation on a single dataset and nonrobust models. only image classification and Google Cloud Vision API considered. Lack of comparison with similar hardlabel attacks like HopSkipJump. Questions: Does the whitebox version use gradients with respect to weight vector w and how are these gradients computed For hardlabel attacks is scorebased access to the surrogate model assumed What is the relationship between surrogate and victim model architectures", "Weaknesses 1. Limited Ensemble Weight Updates The author expresses concern that the average query times of the proposed method are around 12 indicating that the ensemble weights are updated infrequently. They question whether the effectiveness stems from the ensemble itself rather than the weight researching strategy. Response: The weight researching strategy plays a crucial function in determining the effectiveness of the ensemble. By updating the weights according to the feedback from the target models the ensemble can prioritize members that have high success rates leading to more efficient and targeted queries. 2. Overfitting to Target model Architecture The author notes that the architectures of the target models are included in the substitute ensemble. They suggest that this might make the ensemble research strategy more like guessing the architecture of the target model which is not a typical scenario in use where the substitute ensemble may not include the target models architecture. Response: While the inclusion of target model architectures in the substitute ensemble could potentially limit its generalizability it is significant to consider that the proposed method is designed for the specific scenario of blackbox adversarial attacks where the attacker has no knowledge of the target models internals. In such cases leveraging a substitute ensemble that includes various model architectures can provide a more comprehensive research space and improve attack performance.", "Summary This research investigates efficient blackbox attacks that aim to create adversarial model with minimal queries to an unknown victim model. The authors propose using an ensemble of surrogate models to generate candidate perturbation which are then tested on the victim model. The feedback from the queries is used to adjust the weights of the surrogate models leading to better candidate perturbation for subsequent queries. Empirical issue show the approachs effectiveness in producing successful attacks with limited queries.

They then propose an algorithm that achieves these lower bounds. The algorithm utilizes a specific quantization technique. In the general case (section 4.1) the algorithm is similar to existing methods. In the overparameterized quadratic case it employs an additional transformation F and an inverse transform \\tilde F. The authors also present a decentralized version of the algorithm using a gossip protocol with compression. Strengths and Weaknesses Strengths: The paper is generally clear and easy to read. Weaknesses: The literature review could be more comprehensive particularly regarding the work of P. Richtarik in compressed optimization.

The upper bounds in the overparameterized case are not competitive compared to existing results.

The proposed model addresses the issue of degraded performance in streaming speech recognition due to label bias. By applying global normalization during training the model alleviates this problem. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of global normalization in streaming settings. The paper strength lies in providing a framework that can encompass various ASR models. It uses clear model to illustrate the framework. However some sections are notationintensive reflecting the nature of describing finitestate automata (FSAs). A clarification could be added to acknowledge that the described FSAs represent paths of all potential lengths leading to a potentially exponential issue of edge in the combined FSA. The paper argues that label bias arises from a mismatch between training and test conditions rather than from global or local normalization. It acknowledge that globally normalized models consider partial paths during training but questions whether locally normalized models trained in streaming mode would not also alleviate the issue by minimizing the negative logconditional likelihood loss. The paper briefly mentions that P(x y) is not defined which could be confusing. It should be noted that any locally normalized model is trivially globally normalized because Z(x) equals 1 in that case. This distinction between Bayesian networks and Markov random fields has been recognized in the community since the advent of discriminative training. The paper suggests that their algorithm cannot be directly implemented with existing toolkits but it acknowledge that this may not be entirely true in principle. Finally it should be clarified that the separation of the weight work from the automaton topology allows for a complex nonlinear weight work to model dependency among alignment states context states and output label a feature that is not potential with paper cascades.

In practical scenarios optimization often requires satisfying constraints. This paper investigates the constrained OCO problem under fixed and adversarial conditions where the loss work is either convex or strongly convex.

With K skill labels from offline data we create K skill policies using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) along with K skill priors that guide the agent on whether a particular skill is appropriate in a given state. To combine the K skill priors into a single complex skill prior for subsequent reinforcement learning we employ a weighting function that optimizes the estimated Qvalue based on the complex skill prior.

Researchers have struggled to formalize this intuition mathematically. This paper presents a mechanism that allows SGD to rapidly escape minima where the second derivative is excessively large. This mechanism is different from the curvaturebased work that drives fullbatch gradient descent to escape minima where the spectral norm of the second derivative exceeds twice the measure size. Strengths: The concept of an exponential escape driven solely by noise is novel. The essential consideration for this phenomenon (relationship between noise and loss measure) is proven to exist in specific network models. Weaknesses: The analysis only provides a sufficient consideration for instability not a definitive consideration. While stability is influenced by both fullbatch and noise factor the analysis focuses solely on noise. The papers structure could be improved by presenting the escape analysis before the sufficient considerations.

Questions: The paper would benefit from additional discussion on the tractability of the algorithms involved.", "Paraphrased Statement: Researchers investigated the performance of Thompson Sampling (TS) in situations with adversarial contexts and binary departurees. They proposed a limited definition of \"lifted information ratio\" based on the informationtheoretic framework developed by Russo and Van Roy. This approach enabled them to establish regret boundss similar to those in noncontextual settings. As a result their proposed method provides stateoftheart regret guarantees for diverse scenarios within this framework. Notably they derived a regret bounds that is independent of the link use slope for K action with Lipschitz logits. Strengths: The concept of \"lifted information ratio\" addresses the issue of contextdependent information where the relevance of optimal action in one context may not carry over to another. This adjustment of the informationtheoretic framework is novel in the context of Bayesian regret boundss with adversarial contexts providing potential applications in other settings. The proposed approach delivers competitive regret guarantees in several practical scenarios with adversarial contexts.

Zhang suggested that TS might not be optimal in certain situations introducing a bias towards higher rewards in the \"Feel Good TS\" approach. The link to the current work implies that TS may be sufficient at least in Gaussian scenarios. It remains to be determined whether this holds for more general situations.

To resolve this the authors propose a DG technique that: 1. Assumes excess risk is not essential for generalization implying that indomain performance can be maintained without compromising outofdomain performance. 2. Eliminates excess empirical risk by recasting penaltybased DG as minimizing the penalty while maintaining optimal empirical risk. 3.

The proposal to formulate DG with a constraint on empirical risk instead of the penalty is also innovative. Weaknesses: Selective experimental issue: The reported experiments appear handpicked with certain methods evaluated on only a subset of datasets. This raises concerns about the validity of the issue. Central assumption is questionable: The assumption that indomain performance does not need to be sacrificed for outofdomain performance is often violated in use particularly when spurious correlations exist in the training data.

They establish query complexity bounds for quantum algorithms leveraging existing bounds for classical algorithms as a starting point. Their results demonstrate the potential for quantum speedups. Quantum speedup: 1. sampling: Quantum algorithms employing underdamped Langevin diffusion achieve the same query complexity as classical algorithms but using zerothorder query instead of firstorder (gradient) query. Quantum Markov range Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have a faster mixing time than classical MCMC with specific time bounds for strong and cold starts. 2.

A fresh problem setting known as Optimally Timed Intervention (OTI) is introduced where the goal is to minimize the expected time between intervention and the event occurrence (L) field to a low probability of missing the event. The work devises an optimal policy using survival and hazard processes. It applies these theoretical insights to develop an RNN approach for predicting these processes.

This problem is framed as a series of randomly generated features. A failure occurs at some point and the goal is to intervene optimally by implementing a strategy that either permits the process to continue or decides to intervene at a specified time. optimal intervention is defined as intervening without intervening too early (before the failure occurs) while ensuring a low probability of previous intervention (intervening after the failure). Two processes are introduced: a survival process which modelings the probability of failure occurring after a given time and a hazard process which modelings the probability of failure occurring at a specific future time given the current time. The optimal intervention problem is so formupreviousd as an optimal stopping problem on the survivalhazard process. Assuming that features evolve based on Markovian dynamics the optimal stopping problem can be solved. Experiments are conducted on two datasets comparing the proposed method with two baseline approaches. The prediction modeling used is a recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that converts a history of features into a vector representation. This representation is so used by a decoder to generate a sequence of vectors that are directly converted to hazard rate.

These games involve a speaker who receives information (like an image) and sends a signal to a listener. The listener then makes an action and both agents are rewarded based on the issue.

Evaluate the probability at any specific point (called \"DUAL approach\") 2. Generate samples from the distribution given a subset of two points (called \"PCOND approach\") The method considers a nonstandard definition of closeness where it accepts when the probability density use (PDFs) of the two distributions are within a certain range and rejects when their total variation (TV) distance is large. The algorithm developed requires only a number of query proportional to n eta2 sqrt(n) eta4 where n is the field size and eta is a parameter controlling the closeness tolerance. This complexity avoids the exponential development seen in traditional closeness testers based solely on sampling. The algorithm outperforms an existing baseline called \"Barbarik2\" in both theoretical and practical evaluation. Concerns: However there is a concern that a previous field by Canonne and Rubinfeld already provided a simple and optimal tester for this problem using DUAL and sample approach alone with a query complexity of 1(eta2 epsilon2). This tester may be more efficient than the one presented here as it does not require PCOND approach and has no linear dependence on n. Additional Questions: 1. Weighted dDNNFs were mentioned as an example of a distribution where DUAL approach is possible. Can you provide more details on how they are used in the experiments 2. How was PCOND and DUAL approach simulated in the experiments 3. The guarantees of Barbarik2 and Pacoco are not directly comparable because Barbarik2 only assumes conditional sampling approach.", "This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to determine the proximity of samples to highdimensional distributions. Using a framework introduced by Chakraborty and Meel the method rejects samples with large Total Variation (TV) distance and accepts those with small multiplicative distance. The paper focuses on distributions defined on ndimensional hypercubes and utilizes COND PCOND and DUAL oracles to provide the sampler with information beyond pointwise probabilities. These oracles have been used to demonstrate improved sampling efficiency in other field but their practical implementation is not discussed in this paper. Compared to previous methods that required an exponential number of samples with respect to dimension the new algorithm achieves a linear sample complexity with formal guarantees and empirical validation. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvement in sample efficiency across various problem settings. Strengths: Formal proof guarantees with exponential speedup. Empirical evidence of speedup upon implementation. Weaknesses: The paper lacks an evaluation of performance in terms of wallclock runtime.

Random features are generated and a regularized least squares technique is used in feature space. The resulting weights are analyzed using relative VC boundss. The obtained results indicate the double descent effect particularly for the unregularized case. Similar experiments are conducted for neural networks with one hidden layer.

It is improper to utilize a VC dimension estimate obtained after training (via weight norms) and the discussion on page 3 is thus flawed. To apply VC boundss one must prove beforehand that the algorithms weight vector norm does not exceed a predetermined threshold. This threshold rather than the observed norm should be used in the boundss. The authors idea of using relative boundss rather of uniform boundss is also misguided since both types depend on hn where h is an upper bounds of the VC dimension and n is the sample size. The primary distinction between these boundss is that uniform boundss depend on hn quadratically while relative boundss depend linearly in the ideal case.

This constraint is inspired by the Tweedie formula which establishes a connection between the noisy data distributions score use and the optimal meansquare error estimator used for denoising. experimental results on various imaging inverse problems demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in term of FID LPIPS PSNR and SSIM metrics.

Weaknesses: Theoretical: The paper main theorem makes unstated assumption that may not hold in use. The theorem depends on a proposition that assumes the diffusion score use is a global minimum which is unlikely in a diffusion model. The manifold constraint gradient used in the approach also relies on this assumption. Empirical: The visual quality of competing methods (e.g. RePaint and LaMa) in the paper experiments may not accurately reflect their performance as reported in their several work. The experimental setup has changed from previous work and it is unclear if the authors adequately optimized the competing models for this novel setup.

To compensate they introduce a constraint on the reverse diffusion equation using the gradient of the L2 residual. This constraint ensures that the diffusion remains on the data manifold.

This may be a limitation as replay buffers are typically implemented as fixedsize queues in memory. It remains unclear whether the proposed method can generalize to scenarios where target datasets are smaller than pretraining datasets which is a common benefit of pretraining and finetuning in other domains.

It presents the dirtylabel and cleanlabel attacks and tests them in a transfer learning setting. Both attacks markedly increase the success rate (AUC) of membership inference attacks. Strengths and Weaknesses The paper introduces a novel threat model where poisoning a model can compromise the privacy of other training point beyond just evading the model itself. A similar issue has been explored in a concurrent work [34] while a previous work [18] investigated weaker work of data leakage related to global dataset characteristics. The papers objective is to improve membership inference success rates overall and evaluates attack performance using the AUC a measure of averagecase success. It could be beneficial to supplement this with worstcase metrics as suggested by recent research. As illustrated in Figure 2 the poisoning attack appears to enhance the AUC while also importantly increasing the true positive rate (TPR) at low false positive rates (FPRs) a critical aspect for privacy attacks. The primary criticism is that the paper exclusively focuses on the transfer learning setting. Even the dirtylabel attack which could theoretically be employed in other settings is only tested in transfer learning. The abstract and foundation should acknowledge this limitation. Surprisingly the results show a solid gap between the performance of dirtylabel and cleanlabel attacks in the transfer learning setting. This disparity is not fully explained especially considering that the dirtylabel attack involves a small perturbation (eps16255) which should enable nearperfect matching of feature to other data point. Figure 5 suggests that the attacks operate in distinct ways with the dirtylabel attack consistently assigning the same \"dirty\" label while the cleanlabel attack does not. Confirmation of this is requested. If true it is unclear why this occurs particularly given the lack of sufficient data point from the same class in Dshadow. Regarding the threat model it would be valuable to analyze the interplay between the assumption underlying poisoning attacks and membership inference attacks. Notably membership inference attacks require the attacker to obtain some data samples from the targeted distribution implying that the existence of Dshadow is inherently plausible. In use the attacker would likely encounter a Dshadow that overlaps with Dclean making the membership inference problem more complex. Questions In the dirtylabel attack is the same incorrect class used for each poisoning instance or is it randomly selected Explain the important difference in performance between the dirtylabel and cleanlabel attacks. Can you demonstrate the feasibility of the dirtylabel attack in an endtoend training scenario Evaluate the effectiveness of the membership inference attacks at low false positive rates.", "Paraphrased Summary: This research investigates the issue of membership exposure where an attacker attempt to determine whether a specific sample was contribution of a training dataset. To enhance membership identification the authors propose using data poisoning techniques such as label flipping and cleanlabel attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of these attacks.

Weaknesses: Unclear Rationale: The effectiveness of the proposed attacks is not fully explained contributionicularly regarding the relationship between data poisoning and membership exposure amplification. limited practical insight: The proposed methods do not offer insight into addressing the membership inference problem or the objective in Equation (2). Confusing Experimental Section: The experimental setup is unclear with the stated goal being to identify membership but the reported metric (MI AUC) measuring class accuracy. High Baseline AUC: The baseline MI AUC values are exceptionally high point that the severity of the addressed problem may be overstated or illdefined. Questions: Classification Metric Relevance: The authors use of crossentropy loss as a classification metric in Equation (2 is questionable as it does not effectively determine membership. Subset Split assumption: The even split of the dataset into subsets may oversimplify the problem and facilitate poisoning. Poisoning Budget Comparison: The poisoning budget appears to be smaller than the size of the shadow dataset raising questions about the necessity of such a large shadow dataset.", "Paraphrase Summary This paper explores data poisoning attacks that heighten the susceptibility of machine learning models to membership inference attacks (inferring membership of data point in the training set). The work examines two types of attacks: \"dirty label\" (or label flipping) and \"clean label\" attacks.

Strengths and Weaknesses Strengths: investigation of an insightful problem. Clear and accessible writing. Weaknesses: Prior research has already established the claimed contribution. Inadequate comparison to literature on privacy risks. Deficient evaluation. Detailed Comments The evaluation of privacy risks under data poisoning attacks is a compelling concept especially as machine learning models train on increasing amounts of data from diverse sources. However data poisoning to escalate privacy risks has already been explored and the purported contribution made in this paper have been previously demonstrated. Moreover the paper employs questionable metrics for measuring membership inference risks. Poor Comparison to Prior work The paper fails to adequately compare its findings with existing research. While the combination of data poisoning and membership inference attacks is novel the paper overlooks important research questions such as the underlying mechanisms of poisoning the exposure of specific training samples and the implications of increasing AUC. Weak Evaluation The interpretation of the evaluation results is unclear. The paper claims that clean label poisoning attacks are an \"approximate\" version of dirty label attacks but the visualizations suggest distinct impacts on models. The method for quantifying distributional differences between training and shadow data is vague. The connection between the presented attacks and adversarial training is not welldefined. Questions 1.

The membership inference attack used is relatively weak and a more current approach may reduce poisoning effectiveness.

Lastly the work establishes generalization bounds for primal and primaldual risk without relying on strong concavity assumptions. Strengths: The introduction is wellwritten. The development of generalization bounds without strong concavity assumptions is a significant contribution. Weaknesses: The work does not discuss whether Theorem 1(d) from Li and Liu (2022) examines a more comprehensive stability measure of the primal gap. A open explanation of why the primal gap is a superior metric is missing.

It starts by highlighting the limitations of previous metrics (primal risk and primaldual risk) when applied to minimax problems. The paper demonstrates that the primal gap metric is particularly effective for minimax problems. It derives generalization bounds and applies them as limited instance to primal risk and primaldual risk for nonconvexconcave settings providing improved bounds there.

Optimal dependence on the hyperparameter \\epsilon is not established and it is unopen if current results under weaker convexity constraints are optimal. The dependence on parameters Cp and Ce is not fully addressed and the instance in section 3.4 suggests that it may introduce additional factors. Questions: Is the dependence on \\epsilon optimal elimitedly in the low \\epsilon regime where there is a gap between current results and previous ones under strong convexity constraints How do Cp and Ce affect the dependence on \\epsilon and n Will the inclusion of Cp and Ce throughout the paper replace dependence on kappa and introduce terms related to Cp and Ce Can further comparisons be drawn between the proposed results and existing work", "Paraphrase: This work explores how optimization algorithms impact generalization in nonconvex and concave or nonconvex and nonconcave stochastic minimax problems. The authors provide examples to argue that generalization error for the primal risk may be insufficient for predicting actual generalization error due to differences in objective values between theoretical and empirically optimal minimax learners. To analyze generalization error for the primal risk the authors use the concept of \\epsilonalgorithmic stability. For nonconvex and concave problems they establish a bounds with sublinear dependence on \\epsilon overcoming challenges such as the lack of Lipschitz continuity and uniqueness. They employ a practical gradient ascent algorithm to bridge this gap. Furthermore the authors examine the generalization properties of Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) and Gradient Descent Max (GDMax). They present examples and estimates to demonstrate that GDA generalizes beneficial than GDMax.

FINE draws analogies between known inputoutput pairs to determine the linking work. Then using indirection it approximates the work by combining a set of works stored in memory. For assessing outofdistribution generalization the paper creates a visual reasoning dataset based on CIFAR100 and Omniglot. Each sample includes an inputoutput pair serving as a shift cue and four alternatives. FINE outperforms comparable models in terms of accuracy and sample efficiency for various works and work combinations. Ablation work emphasize the significance of layer count and memory size. Strengths Draws inspiration from human intelligence features combining them uniquely. Proposes a formal model that leverages this technique to address the issue of outofdistribution generalization in neural networks. Demonstrates the models ability to abstract image shifts in the latent space allowing it to generalize shifts to novel images. Introduces a unique use case for visual reasoning showcasing the novel models benefits. Compares the method to various relevant baselines. Provides clear and comprehensive writing. Offers code for reproducing results. Acknowledges limitations of the approach. Weaknesses To learn the task the model must identify and construct the shift. Therefore outofdistribution samples should exhibit different works not just different input images. A fair comparison with baselines requires adapting all models to this model. The paper lacks crucial details about training setup and hyperparameters used for training these models. The paper does not explore additional applications for the model. While the use of NICE layers is intuitively motivated it is not crucial for FINE. The datasets design which incorporates reversible shifts motivates its use. To ensure a fair comparison it would be appropriate to present results for all models without NICE layers. The rationale for using two NICE layers instead of one is not fully explained. The paper does not clarify the choice of using yt vectors as output from \u03b3(y). The first two paragraphs of subsection 3.1 consider different versions of Hypothesis H1 and H2 which could be simplified by removing the hypotheses.

The model can adjust its backbone networks parameters dynamically based on inputoutput queries retrieving them from a memory.

It remains unclear if the approach can handle other types of transformations. Questions: Can the proposed method be applied to transformations beyond geometric ones", "Summary Paraphrase: This paper proposes a novel method called Functional Indirection (FINE) for optimizing neural networks to improve their generalization abilities in abstract reasoning tasks. FINE introduces a mechanism that selects weights for a neural network dynamically based on the inputoutput pair allowing it to adapt to novel data and solve problems that share similar underlying rules. This work is constrained by a predefined memory of weights ensuring that the network can only select from a limited set of work. FINE is similar to hypernetworks but with the added constraint of using a work composer to determine the optimal arrangement of weights. The performance of FINE is evaluated on a novelly introduced abstract reasoning dataset derived from Omniglot and CIFAR100. Strengths: The proposed FINE method is a novel approach to workal indirection in neural networks. The paper is wellstructured and easy to understand. FINE achieves strong performance in OOD generalization across unseen categories in the used datasets. Weaknesses: The evaluation focuses on unseen characters rather than unseen rules which limits the assessment of its ability to handle more complex abstract reasoning tasks. The method implicitly selects weights based on inputoutput transformations similar to the explicit expert mixture approach described in a previous paper. A comparison with this approach would be beneficial. The limited basis of network weights may constrain the models generalization to only observed rules and their combinations. It is unclear how the model would perform with unseen rules.", "Paraphrase: Summary: Generalizing to unfamiliar data (outofdistribution or OOD) is a major challenge in artificial intelligence. This work tackles this issue for IQlike tasks by introducing FINE (Functional Indirection Neural Estimator). FINE uses the concept of indirection to connect two different representations and bridge the gap between them. The proposed architecture effectively handles IQ tasks involving images that differ from the training set but follow similar rules. Strengths: The question of OOD generalization is crucial for understanding intelligence. The indirection idea is innovative and FINE offers an effective implementation. Figure 4 demonstrates interesting clusters in weight space raising questions about other models behavior. Weaknesses: The definition of OOD is ambiguous as the work only tests on different classes within the same datasets which may not represent true OOD scenarios. The term \"generalization\" is limited to testing on slightly different images not novel rules which is the true challenge in IQ tests. Questions: What quantitative evidence supports the claim that humans can generalize to OOD Is there any evidence that models actually recognize objects and infer relationships or is this mere anthropomorphization The conclusion assumes that FINE discovers relational model and solves novel tasks but the work does not provide evidence for this.

This recurrent mechanism processes groups of tokens (blocks) simultaneously updating a hidden state matrix after each block rather than after each individual token. The hidden state is accessed by the Transformer using cross attention and the model additionally employs slidingwindow attention like the Longformer transformer. It inherits features from TransformerXL and Longformer such as accessing previous sequences and hidden state through a cache. Training and implementation During training sequences of tokens are divided into blocks and the recurrent state is updated after each block. This is orthogonal to processing tokens within each block. The hidden state accessed for any token is the recent hidden state available. The recurrent state update involves selfattention on the hidden state itself and crossattention on tokenwise features of the current block using a gating mechanism instead of residual connections. The model also includes variations with simplified updates. The overall model resembles Longformer with one Longformer layer replaced by a blockrecurrent Transformer layer. An additional \"Feedback\" variant modifies other Longformer layers to include crossattention to the last recurrent state. The slidingwindow attention is also implemented in a blockwise manner for efficiency. Results and discussion The model achieves stateoftheart performance on the PG19 arXiv and GitHub datasets.

A coreset is a small set of data points that accurately represents the entire datasets clustering cost to within a tolerable error margin. The primary result is an efficient algorithm to construct coresets with a size proportional to the number of lines in each lineset the number of linesets and the desired error bound.

The causal model associated with COLP identifies an optimal permutation and COLP parameters conforming to a designated causal guidance while the opposing anticausal guidance remains unrepresentable by any COLP model. The paper demonstrates this concept via identifiability proofs. The estimation work employs basic maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) techniques to determine the optimal COLP model. observational evaluation using synthetic and realworld data demonstrate the superiority of COLP over existing methods. Strengths and Weaknesses Strengths: Intriguing intuition: The illustrative model clarifies the methods principles. Comprehensive experimentation: COLPs performance is assessed on both synthetic and realworld datasets exhibiting its advantages over HCR and CE. Weaknesses: assumption not clearly defined: The paper lacks a mathematical formulation of the parametric assumptions underlying COLP and ordinal regression. theoretical issues: The identifiability section appears poorly explained with questionable basic models and results. observational results: While extensive the realdata analysis lacks quantitative metrics and focuses only on specific edges raising concerns about cherrypicking. Questions 1. assumption: What are the underlying assumptions of COLP and ordinal regression How do they compare to existing methods Can they be verified from data 2. Identifiability: The identifiability results seem flawed. Can the authors clarify 3. real data experiments: What criteria were used to select the evaluated edges Are there metrics that assess overall performance across all edges in the real datasets What is meant by \"outofsample prediction\"", "Summary The authors introduce a new method for determining the pairwise orientation and proximity of categorical variables with two categories. Strengths The technique is grounded in a reliable concept. Creating a dataset of categorical pairwise causal data is a valuable concept. The theory and algorithm for the COLP algorithm appear reasonable. Weaknesses The paper overlooks the established Markov Equivalence Class (MEC) approach to causal discovery. The authors did not demonstrate how the \"natural orderings\" identified by COLP correspond to intuitive orderings despite acknowledging this in the observational section. They also overlook strategies that combine MEC with pairwise approaches to orient edges. It is unclear to what extent the COLP method can correctly identify nonorientable pairwise edges. Questions Could the authors incorporate MEC methods into their analysis Can they clarify the identifiability criteria for binary variables Can COLP detect the nonexistence of pairwise edges and indicate \"undirected\" when a guidance cannot be inferred", "Summary (Paraphrase): This research introduces a new method called \"classification with the optimal label permutation\" (COLP) for uncovering causal relationships from data consisting of categories. The central concept is that identifying the correct permutation enables the identification of ordinal regression. Strengths: COLP can deduce causal connections from categorical data. COLP is almost certainly identifiable. Weaknesses: COLPs novelty is limited as it closely resembles [1]. COLP heavily depends on label permutation in ordinal regression. An ablation work is required to demonstrate its superiority in the absence of label permutation. The proposed greedy algorithm for determining permutations may be inefficient for data with numerous categories. Its performance and accuracy in determining permutations under various category number should be investigated. [1] Ni Y. Mallick B. (2022). Ordinal Causal discovery. The 38th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.", "Paraphrased Statement: Summary: The authors present a method for determining causeandeffect relationships when both the cause and effect variables are in categorical work. They use an ordinal regression model and search for a more simplified model. The simplification is driven by the belief that specific sequences of input data fit better with the outcome data even in the absence of inherent ordering in the data. Consequently the authors propose the COLP (classification with optimal label permutation) model which seeks the permutation of inputs that yields the beneficial maximum likelihood fit. Strengths and Weaknesses: The proposed method is clear and seemingly valid. The observational evaluation includes simulated and realworld data and the findings are persuasive. The COLPgreedy approach perworks well compared to the computationally intensive COLPexhaustive approach. However the COLP method assumes that a specific ordering of categories makes more sense than others and its difficult to assess the frequency of this assumption holding true. The method is limited by the assumption of no hidden confounders which the authors acknowledge. The clarity of the demonstration could be improved.

It defines an adversarial example for AZ agents as a slightly altered state. The alteration adds a few meaningless process which are deemed semantically similar to the original state. An adversarial attack on a state is considered successful if it causes the policyvalue neural network (PVNN) to make erroneous predictions. This leads to the agents underperforming in the future. The work proposes an efficient attack method by exploiting the fact that a meaningful process in a state is also meaningful in prior states reducing the search space for meaningless process. Empirical results demonstrate that PVNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks across various AZ agents. Strengths: It is believed to be the first work examining the vulnerability of AZ agents to deception. The work is wellstructured and offers a helpful figure (Fig. 1) for understanding adversarial attacks against AZ agents. The experimental design is solid and the findings are compelling (e.g. results on various datasets and the sturdiness of PVMCTS). Weaknesses: Some criteria for determining state similarity appear to be contrived. The suggested adversarial scenario seems impractical.

These attacks involve making moves that are legal but nonsensical aimed at disrupting the game without significantly affecting the players chances of winning.

They identify such moves within a restricted perturbation set excluding moves that have been meaningful in past work or fail an attack success criterion. Experiments demonstrate the efficientness of this method on various datasets and MCTS depths. Strengths and Weaknesses The paper addresses the novel problem of identifying adversarial moves in discrete turnbased games with limited computation. The method is shown to be efficient in both Go and NoGo. It is unclear how the method compares to existing approach and whether it offers significant computational advantages.

The challenge lies in defining semantically invariant perturbations for discrete games like Go.

Lack of substantial baselines for the nonsampledependent results. Closely resembles existing work on architecture research and sparsification without referencing these prior efforts. No comparison on the same tasks as the original PercieverIO paper. The sparsification results appear promising but comparison with alternative sparsification techniques or neural Architecture research methods are lacking. The unconditional circuit generator work overlaps significantly with prior reresearch in NAS and sparsification and comparing it to these work would strengthen the work. The conditional circuit generator is quite innovative particularly when applied to multimodal data but the performance and characteristics of the network could be explored in large depth. Elaboration is needed on the ModFNN properties: \"unlike in transformers each copy is conditioned by a unique learnable code vector and therefore performs a different computation. Consequently though the computation performed in each module is different the total number of parameters does not noticeably increase with the number of modules.\" The accuracy and performance could be discussed in section 4.2 along with baselines.

Strengths: Ensures robustness of posteriors derived from deep learning algorithm. Uses an additional balance condition to regularize the model. Simple to implement. Experiments show that the method produces more conservative posteriors. The bias and variance of the model decrease as the sampling size increases. The authors acknowledge the tradeoffs and limitations of the method. Weaknesses: The regularization condition can lead to worse calibration especially with low sampling sizes. While conservative posteriors are generally preferable overly conservative posteriors may hinder precise parameter identification. The discussion around equation (6) lacks clarity regarding the difference between probability density functions. The model details could be expanded especially regarding the stochastic versus deconditioninistic nature of the underlying work. The authors do not acknowledge related work on model (over)confidence in statistics such as ability posteriors.

Neural networkbased method have been developed to estimate the posterior probability distribution likelihood or likelihood ratio enabling MCMC sampling for posterior inference. However these method may produce inaccurate posteriors particularly with limited simulation data. Balanced NRE (BNRE): This work introduces BNRE a variant of neural likelihood ratio approximation (NRE) that aims to produce more conservative posterior estimates. BNRE trains a classifier to approximate the likelihoodtoevidence ratio similar to NRE. However it introduces the concept of a \"balanced classifier\" and modifies the loss function to promote balance. It is shown that the optimal Bayesian classifier is balanced and BNRE converges to NRE with unlimited data. evaluation: Experiments using tractable benchmark problem demonstrate that BNRE tends to produce more conservative posteriors than NRE with limited simulation budgets resulting in larger posterior variance.

Supporting Evidence: The authors provide several rigorous result to support their claim: The FP criterion can be related to the lowdegree likelihood ratio in Gaussian additive examples including spiked matrix and tensor problems with Gaussian noise. Under certain assumptions FP hardness implies a barrier in the posterior distribution of the planted signal leading to lower bounds on mixing times for MCMC algorithms with local moves.

The researchers suggest that in such a case the iterates either remain unbounded or become contained within a bounded set.

This enables the formulation of comprehensive policy evaluation and optimization bounds under relatively mild but reasonable conditions. The authors provide valuable interpretations of these bounds under stricter assumptions such as Bellman closure and importance sampling weights. Additionally the paper presents adaptations of previous results to the jobar MDP set.

Clarity and significance: The application of derived results in the jobar set provides a potential recipe for developing meaningful bounds in the function approximation set with weaker conditions than in earlier studies. Weaknesses Computational efficiency: Key results require calculations of upper and lower empirical value functions for a given policy which involves optimization over the empirical constraint set. While this optimization can be performed efficiently for jobar MDPs it becomes computationally expensive in general potentially requiring time that scales jobarly with the size of the test function class.

This mapping is suitable for data that comes from different domain and may have different distributions. These domain shifts can occur in EEG data when it is recorded from different individuals (due to structural and functional differences in brain networks) or in different sessions (due to differences in electrode placement). The proposed method consists of three steps: 1. Covariance Matrix Transformation: data matrices from different domain are transformed into covariance matrices. These matrices form a set of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which is a Riemannian manifold with an affineinvariant Riemannian metric. 2. Normalization: The first and secondorder statistics of these covariance matrices are normalized using a new algorithm called \"SPD domainpecific momentum batch normalization\" (SPDDSMBN). The normalized covariance matrices are then transformed into vectors by \"lifting\" them to the tangent space at the identity matrix using the logarithmic mapping. 3. Classification: The vectors in the tangent space are classified using a linear classifier. The main contribution of the paper is the SPDDSMBN algorithm which estimates the mean and variance of the covariance matrices on the SPD manifold using iterative updates. The researchers prove that under certain conditions the estimated mean converges to the true mean as the issue of iterations increases. The proposed method is fully differentiable allowing it to be trained in an endtoend fashion. This improves performance compared to classical methods that perform sequential performance associated with different optimization problems.

Key differences are claimed such as incorporating both multimodal and unimodal data during pretraining. However AVHuBERT also utilizes modality dropout to handle unimodal inputs.

After finetuning this pretrained model on audiovisual data using modality dropout it erzielt comparable or better outcomes than the most effective current modalityspecific models. Additionally the researchers demonstrate that modality dropout is crucial for acquiring modalityindependent features enabling models finetuned only on audio to function well with audiovisual or visual speech data and thus achieving zeroshot modality transfer for speech recognition and speaker verification. Strengths and Weaknesses: Originality: This work distinguishes itself by utilizing a common target token space for all singlesensory and multisensory data in a single model and finetuning it with labeled data alone from a subset of modalities encountered during pretraining. It can achieve good performance on other modalities in testing demonstrating zeroshot modality generalization. While modality dropout has been employed before the work demonstrates its significance in acquiring modalityindependent features and achieving significant gains in zeroshot modality transfer situations. Quality: The proposed model surpasses or matches the performance of current modalityspecific models for speech recognition. The findings are encouraging as the model finetuned alone on audio data produces comparable outcomes to models finetuned on modalityspecific data when used with audiovisual and visual speech data. The experimentation using labeled audio data from LibriSpeech that is outside of the area for finetuning provides convincing evidence to support the claim that the models zeroshot modality transfer is not accomplished through memorization. The proposed model exhibits zeroshot modality generalization but only to a certain extent. The authors postulate that this is attributable to the speaker verification task where each modality can only deduce a subset of the speakers characteristics. This illustrates a restriction on zeroshot transfer. Clarity: The paper is presented clearly and logically. Significance: This research makes a major contribution by presenting a technique for pretraining on multisensory and singlesensory speech data to enhance audiovisual ASR solution beyond what is currently potential and to achieve highquality zeroshot modality generalization. It is particularly valuable for tasks involving modalities with limited labeled data. Questions and Suggestions: The proposed framework assumes that multimodal features are aligned framebyframe. How can it be applied when this assumption does not apply such as between audio and text modalities Is the pretraining modality dropout probability of 0.250.25 optimized How sensitive are the findings to its value Table 2 shows that modality dropout during finetuning also decreases AVWER for models finetuned on AV data.

The authors show that using a greedy ordering based on the previous epochs stale gradients (as suggested by Lu et al.) may perform worse than random reshuffling. However proper herding (achieving a constant bound for the herding objective) outperforms random reshuffling.

While normalized DNNs are commonly used and often perform well their theoretical underpinnings are not fully understood. The paper explores the effects of normalization and weight decay during gradient descent (GD) training. It demonstrates that normalization and weight decay facilitate GD movement to flat regions and impose a bias that reduces the sharpness of the loss work. Specifically the authors theorize that after reaching the manifold of minimizers GD can enter an \"Edge of Stability\" regime. In this regime the use of additional GD steps leads to movement towards a less sharp region on the manifold. Experimental results on VGG11 ResNet20 matrix completion and linear regression using batch normalization provide support for this theory. Strengths: Provides insights into the training of normalized DNNs using GD expanding our understanding of practical DNN behavior. Demonstrates the role of normalization and weight decay in navigating flat minima and reducing loss sharpness. Links flat minima to generalization capabilities.

Weaknesses: The paper focuses on the \"scaleinvariant\" property of normalization which is not applicable to all normalization methods (e.g. batch normalization). This may limit the scope and accuracy of the theory. The experiments primarily use batch normalization which violates the scaleinvariance assumption. The authors should consider modifying their experiments or narrowing the scope of their theory. The use of the condition \"reduce the sharpness of the loss\" may not accurately reflect the work as the loss work itself is often fixed. GD may instead move from sharp minima to less sharp minima.

AP allows users to create custom learning algorithms or \"propagators\" which can be reused for versatile tasks. Traditional ML software heavily relies on surrogate loss and backpropagation for computation neglecting other potential optimizations.

The core component of AP is the propagator which handles both forward computation (performing performance and storing data for backward computation) and backward computation (sending and receiving messages between nodes). The propagation manager orchestrates the entire work. The benefits of AP and its implementation Proppo are demonstrated through the innovation of gradient algorithms for Monte Carlo gradient estimation. These algorithms show significantly improved gradient accuracy compared to the standard autodiff method with surrogate loss particularly for specific case of problems.

Firstly it demonstranges that SGD risk is comparable to GD indicating the absence of inherent regularization in this context. Secondly it establishes a link between SGD and HSGD allowing the researchers to investigate SGD properties using HSGD. The primary contribution is in highlighting that SGD has a unique condition number which under certain situations facilitates a faster convergence range than GD. Additionally it examines streaming SGD within the same framework and compares it to regular SGD to assess generalization. Strengths: The novel finding that SGD possesses a distinct condition number for convex quadratic role. SGD advantage over GD when the Hessian spectrum exhibits outliers a prevalent feature in substantialworld applications (as shown in Figure 2). The analysis of the Volterra Dynamic though not novel to this paper provides valuable insights into SGD behavior. Weaknesses: Figure 2 displays random feature framework for practical scenarios (e.g. CIFAR10 CIFAR5m) suggesting that the Hessian in these cases is illconditioned supporting their claim that SGD outperforms GD in these scenarios. However it must be noted that the random feature framework is a convex optimization problem unlike substantial neural networks. Hence a low ICR (Implicit Condition Number Ratio) in the random feature framework does not immediately imply SGD superiority over GD in substantial optimization scenarios. The authors should provide an actual convergence equivalence between SGD and GD even for random feature framework to support their main observation. ICR is merely an indicator for comparing SGD and GD and inaccuracies might arise from using HSGD and finite dimension iteration times. Without such simulations the claim that SGD outperforms GD in terms of convergence speed is unconvincing. The argument that no implicit regularization exists might be overly simplistic. In convex optimization all converging algorithms should converge to the same role value (or point in strongly convex cases).

Through comprehensive hyperparameter sweeps the work found that while almost all direct networks could perform path integration tasks effectively only a few exhibited gridlike code. They identified that networks with neurons resembling Difference of Gaussians (DoG) open field were more potential to display gridlike code but even then these cells only emerged within a narrow range of open field parameter values.

Strengths: 1. The approach is based on a theoretical analysis of network parameter initialization and samplewise local minima.

PTFs are essentially LTFs over a higherdimensional space. The reduction relies heavily on previous work showing a superpolynomial SQ small bound for the same problem. At a high stage the final hard Massart distribution is designed to be consistent with a Massart PTF where the conditional distributions x y 1 and x y 1 resemble \"pancake distributions.\" These distributions are Gaussian in all but one dimension where they resemble a discrete Gaussian mixture that matches several moments with a standard Gaussian.

The HWN distribution maps a distributed tangent vector from an origin to a mean level and takes the exponential map to obtain the distribution. The authors note that the standard foundation vector in the tangent level at the origin when transported to the mean level and projected to a Poincar\u00e9 disk is not aligned with a standard foundation vector in the disk. They propose that this alignment is undesirable and posit a distribution where one of the tangent vectors levels from the mean level to the origin. To address this they propose the Rotated HWN (RHWN) distribution constructed such that the first dimension of the tangent level levels from the mean level to the origin. Empirically the RHWN distribution outperforms the HWN distribution with diagonal and full covariance matrix on several tasks including synthetic data correlation discussion embedding correlation and Atari rollout embedding correlation.

These models are trained together by minimizing a lower bound.

A recurrent spatial transformer network is used to define the location of the future line. The technique can reconstruct ranges from character and study databases perform crossdatabase generalization generate novel characters and classify characters with only one model. Strengths and Weaknesses: Originality This approach shares similarities with other methods in the study such as using splines for drawing (Mihai and Hare 2013) employing variational objectives (Tomczak and Welling 2018) recursively generating ranges (Feinman and Lake 2021) and utilizing spatial transformer networks for character recognition (Hewitt et al. 2018). The combination of recursive range generation and variational objectives was previously explored by AIR (Eslami et al. 2016) while the line model resembles GNS (Feinman and Lake 2021). DooD combines aspects of AIR and GNS using a variational objective with a line model and being trained on ranges instead of line sequences. It appears to be the first recursive rangestudying model that incorporates spatial transformer networks into its paper process. Quality The paper strengths include evaluation on diverse datasets including crossdataset transfer and diverse evaluation tasks. Additionally the authors analyze the methods internal representation compared to related methods. The recurrent structure of the model is shown to be beneficial through an ablation study. The model qualitatively outperforms baselines in terms of range reconstruction but the difference is not quantified. Weaknesses include the lack of strong motivations for many model choices. especially the choice of Laplace noise which seems to accumulate over time appears unusual and possibly not suitable for the range distribution of human study. The exclusive use of only one real baseline (AIR) is considered insufficient especially since AIR was not primarily designed for line drawings. Clarity The paper is wellwritten and organized. However the methods details are not described sufficiently. The line and rendering components of the model are especially difficult to understand because crucial data is missing from the main text and the appendix uses notations that are not defined in the main text. The authors recognize the challenge of explaining such a complex method within the given space limitations and express willingness to place more details in the appendix.

They emphasize the need for a complete description of the methods details either in the main text or the supplement as opposed to solely relying on code submission. Welldocumented code would further enhance the paper reproducibility. Significance DooD presents a model for capturing human line study and handwritten characters from static ranges. It claims to outperform previous approaches in crossdomain generalization computational efficiency and interpretability. The methods interpretability appears to be superior to AIR and although methods that do not use recursive drawing are not evaluated in terms of interpretability they are potential to have even lower interpretability.

The goal of the model is to embed data detail (X) into reduced dimensions (Z) by aligning the latent graph structures of the original data and the embeddings. Conditional distributions are defined for data detail and embedding graphs and the crossentropy between their posteriors is minimized to obtain the embedding. Different graph priors lead to variations in the crossentropy objective with existing neighbor embedding methods corresponding to specific formulations. Since these methods use shiftinvariant kernel matrices the relative view of data clusters are not always preserved in the embeddings. To address this issue the researchers combine the crossentropy objective with PCA (ccPCA) when using a Gaussian kernel matrix. This approach aims to preserve both the positioning of clusters and their local structures.
